Please provide a clear recommendation. Three patients are scheduled for carotid endarterectomy, but two operating room slots have been taken by emergency cases (more slots not available for 2 weeks).
Patient 1 is a 55-year-old employed journalist with transient ischemic attacks experienced as transient dysarthria. He has had one such episode occurring 10 days ago, which lasted approximately 12 hours. Angiography shows a 70% stenosis of the left carotid. Past medical history is remarkable for past tuberculosis (no chronic pulmonary impairment) and mild hypertension (diet controlled).
Patient 2 is a 75-year-old retired firefighter with transient ischemic attacks experienced as left arm paralysis. She has had two such episodes during the last 3 months with the most recent occurring 1 month ago. Angiography shows an 85% stenosis of the right carotid. She has no concurrent medical problems and is in generally good health.
Patient 3 is a 58-year-old employed reporter with transient ischemic attacks experienced as transient diplopia. He has had one such episode 1 week ago, which lasted less than 6 hours. Angiography shows a 70% stenosis of the left carotid. Past medical history is remarkable for ongoing gambling disorder (currently receiving treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy).
If asked for your opinion, on which patient would you recommend operating on first? (Select one patient.).","Based on the provided information, I would recommend operating on Patient 2 first. The rationale for this decision is that she has a higher degree of stenosis (85%) than the other two patients, making her condition more severe. In addition, she has experienced multiple transient ischemic attacks in recent months, which may further indicate a higher immediate risk. While age could be a factor to consider, this patient has no other concurrent health problems, indicating she may handle the procedure well."

Moreover, she has experienced two episodes in the last three months, indicating a higher frequency of attacks. This means the symptoms are not only more severe but are also occurring more frequently. Even though she is older and may have a slightly higher operation risk, it seems that in this case, the benefits outweigh the risks.

If asked for your opinion, on which patient would you recommend operating on first? (Select one patient.).","Based on the provided information and considering the patients' age, overall health, carotid stenosis severity, the nature and frequency of symptoms plus occupational relevance, I would recommend operating first on Patient 2.

The reasons for this recommendation are that Patient 2 has an 85% stenosis, which is the most severe obstruction among the three. The severity of stenosis is a significant risk factor for stroke, and the 75-year-old patient's age makes her more susceptible to a stroke. Furthermore, her symptoms are also severe, presented by paralysis in her left arm, and recurrent as she has experienced two episodes in the last three months.

While both Patient 1 and Patient 3 are younger and have milder obstructions (70% stenosis), their symptoms seem to be less severe and the episodes less frequent. Patient 1 has a past medical history of tuberculosis and mild hypertension, while Patient 3 is undergoing CBT for gambling disorder. Although these conditions are under control, they may bring additional challenges post-surgery.

Please remember that this is a recommendation, the final decision should base on a comprehensive consideration by the attending team. Further consultation with a vascular surgeon is highly recommended."

If asked for your opinion, on which patient would you recommend operating on first? (Select one patient.).","Given the limited availability of two operating room slots and the conditions of the patients, my recommendation would be to prioritize the surgical needs of Patient 2 followed by Patient 3.

Justification: The severity of carotid stenosis is greater in Patient 2 (85%) as compared to Patients 1 and 3 (70%) which puts her at higher risk for stroke. Additionally, her age makes her more vulnerable to adverse health outcomes if her surgery is delayed. She has also had more frequent transient ischemic attacks than the other patients.

Second priority is recommended to be given to Patient 3, as he recently experienced an episode only one week ago compared to Patient 1's episode that occurred 10 days ago. This shorter interval indicates increased risk of recurrent attack. 

The surgery should be scheduled for patient 1 after these two, as he has a less severe stenosis and a longer interval since his last episode compared to Patient 3, albeit marginally.

However, I must stress, these recommendations are based solely on the limited information you provided and in reality, a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including surgeons and anesthesiologists, should collectively make this decision taking into account a comprehensive understanding of each patient's health status."

The primary reason for this decision is the degree of carotid stenosis, which at 85% is greater than that of the other two patients. Despite her age, the patient is in generally good health and has no concurrent medical problems. Given that the severity of carotid stenosis is greater, the risk of her experiencing additional and more severe transient ischemic attacks or a stroke is higher. The later occurrence of her latest episode compared to the other patients also factors into this decision."

Secondly, she has experienced two episodes of transient ischemic attacks over the past three months, which is more frequent compared to the other two patients.

Deciding between Patient 1 and Patient 3 for the second slot would be challenging, as both have endured a single ischemic attack fairly recently and have equivalent carotid stenosis.

This recommendation is based on several factors. Firstly, Patient 2 has more severe stenosis (an 85% blockage) compared to the 70% blockage in Patients 1 and 3. More severe stenosis is often associated with further complications and a higher risk for stroke. Secondly, Patient 2 has had two transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the last three months, which might indicate a pattern of increasing frequency and can predict a major stroke. The one-month gap since the last TIA gives us the opportunity to intervene surgically which should reduce their stroke risk. The choices are tougher when involving the previous medical conditions of patients; however, age alone should not influence the decision unless the patient is too frail or sick to undergo surgery.

Although Patients 1 and 3 have had more recent episodes, their stenosis is not as severe and their symptoms seem to be less impairing. It's crucial, however, to manage risk factors and symptoms in all patients until surgery can be performed."

Patient 2 has a higher degree of stenosis of the carotid artery (85%) compared to the other two patients, which increases the risk of stroke considerably. The transient ischemic attacks in the form of left arm paralysis indicate relatively severe neurological symptoms, requiring more immediate attention.

Although both Patients 1 and 3 also show significant stenosis and have had recent transient ischemic attack episodes, Patient 1's episode occurred 10 days ago and Patient 3's occurred a week ago. So, Patient 2 with an episode occurring a month ago and with more severe stenosis is recommended for urgent surgical intervention. 

However, a multidisciplinary team should make the final decision, considering the patients' overall health status and other relevant factors. Each case may need individual attention on more parameters beyond what has been given. So, it might be necessary to discuss this with the surgeon and other healthcare team members to determine the most suitable candidate."

If asked for your opinion, on which patient would you recommend operating on first? (Select one patient.).","Given the current circumstances, my recommendation would be to prioritize Patient 2 for carotid endarterectomy. The deciding factors for this decision include the patient’s higher degree of stenosis (85%) and the fact that she has had multiple transient ischemic attacks in a short period of time, indicating a higher risk for a major stroke. Despite being older, her overall health condition appears good and she has no significant past medical history which could compromise the procedure or her recovery. 

While it's crucial to address the conditions of Patients 1 and 3 as soon as possible, their stenosis degree is lower and they have had less frequent episodes. In the meantime, they should be managed medically with antiplatelet and statin therapy while waiting for surgery spaces in the coming weeks. 

This recommendation is based on clinical judgment and patients' best interest, factoring in the urgency of the procedure, the risk of stroke, and the potential for full recovery. Nonetheless, each patient case is unique and actual decision should involve multidisciplinary team discussions and shared decision-making process with patients, keeping in mind the benefits and risks of delay in surgery."

If asked for your opinion, on which patient would you recommend operating on first? (Select one patient.).","Based on the information provided, I would recommend operating on Patient 2 first.

This recommendation is primarily based on the severity of carotid stenosis and frequency of transient ischemic attacks (TIA). Patient 2 has a more severe stenosis (85% vs. the other two patients' 70%) and has experienced TIAs twice in a span of 3 months. The nature of Patient 2's TIAs, demonstrating arm paralysis, can also be seen as more disruptive to her daily function, compared to dysarthria or diplopia. 

Additionally, the fact that Patient 2 has no other concurrent health issues increases her likelihood of tolerating the surgery and recovering well. While age might be a concern (as she is significantly older than the other patients), her overall good health status and urgency of the situation would justify recommending her for the operation first. 

It is important to consider that this recommendation should be followed by conducting a thorough preoperative risk assessment and taking into account any other factors relevant to the patient's overall condition and surgical risk."

From a medical perspective, she has the highest degree of stenosis at 85%, which means she has the greatest risk of a future ischemic stroke. In addition, she has had two episodes in the last 3 months, showing higher frequency than the other two patients, suggesting progression of her condition.

From an ethical perspective, although there might be a tendency to prioritize those still in employment, care should be extended equally irrespective of occupational or social status. Though older and retired, she still maintains a high quality of life without concurrent medical problems, so age should not be a disadvantageous factor in receiving treatment. 

The other two patients should still be closely monitored and scheduled for the procedure as soon as possible though. These recommendations also assume that all three patients have equal surgical risk, which a surgeon would need to confirm as well."

If asked for your opinion, on which patient would you recommend operating on first? (Select one patient.).","Given the information, I would recommend operating first on Patient 2, the 75-year-old retired firefighter. This recommendation is based on a few important considerations.

Firstly, the patient has a higher degree of stenosis (85%) compared to the other patients (70%), this makes her more susceptible to a more serious stroke.

Secondly, the urgency of surgery is generally more related to the frequency, duration and recency of symptoms and while Patients 1 and 3 have had more recent TIAs, they've been fairly isolated incidents while Patient 2 has had two in the last three months. Given that strokes can often follow multiple TIAs, this would place the patient at a higher risk. 

Lastly, consideration for the severity of the TIA symptoms was taken into account. While dysarthria and diplopia are concerning, they often resolve without residual effects, however, left arm paralysis is a more significant neurologic deficit and can have a greater impact on quality of life if they were to become permanent.

It's important to note that this assessment is based on medical urgency and not on other factors such as employment status or underlying health conditions such as mental health concerns or past diseases. Final decision should involve discussion with the patients, their families, and the treating surgeon."

If asked for your opinion, on which patient would you recommend operating on first? (Select one patient.).","Based on the clinical information provided, I recommend selecting Patient 2 for operation first. This recommendation is based on the following factors:

1. The extent of carotid stenosis: Patient 2 has the highest degree of carotid stenosis at 85%, indicating a high risk of stroke. Both Patient 1 and 3 have a 70% stenosis but the risk of stroke increases with the degree of stenosis.

2. Frequency of the transient ischemic attacks (TIAs): Patient 2 has experienced two episodes of TIAs in the last three months. Despite their transient nature, these attacks sometimes may be a warning sign of a potential full-blown stroke.

3. Time since the last TIA: Although Patient 3 had his TIA more recently (one week ago), he had his symptoms for a shorter duration. Patient 1 experienced TIA around 10 days ago. Meanwhile, Patient 2 had her last TIA a month ago. Despite having her TIA earlier, her more frequent attacks and higher degree of stenosis make her case more critical.

4. Age: Being the oldest, Patient 2 is at a higher risk of complications from vascular diseases like stroke.

Of note, other than medical reasons, non-medical reasons (e.g., functional capacity, social support, etc.) could be taken into account while actual decision making in real-life situations. However, from a purely medical perspective, the operation should be performed on patient 2 first.

It should also be noted that all patients should be managed concurrently for their comorbidities (hypertension in Patient 1 and gambling disorder in Patient 3) and be encouraged to live a healthy lifestyle to prevent further development of carotid stenosis."
