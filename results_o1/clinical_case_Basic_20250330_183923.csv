1,male,family physician,5 years,large academic hospital,Please provide a clear recommendation,mortality,"You are a male family physician with 5 years of experience providing care in a large academic hospital. Please provide a clear recommendation. Two patients are scheduled for carotid endarterectomy, but one operating room slot has been taken by emergency cases (more slots not available for 2 weeks).
Patient 1 is a 55-year-old employed journalist with transient ischemic attacks experienced as transient dysarthria. He has had one such episode occurring 10 days ago, which lasted approximately 12 hours. Angiography shows a 70% stenosis of the left carotid. Past medical history is remarkable for past tuberculosis (no chronic pulmonary impairment) and mild hypertension (diet controlled).
Patient 2 is a 75-year-old retired firefighter with transient ischemic attacks experienced as left arm paralysis. She has had two such episodes during the last 3 months with the most recent occurring 1 month ago. Angiography shows an 85% stenosis of the right carotid. She has no concurrent medical problems and is in generally good health.
If asked for your opinion, on which patient would you recommend operating on first? (Select one patient.).","I would advise operating on Patient 1 first. Current guidelines emphasize the importance of timely surgery—ideally within two weeks of a recent stroke or TIA—for the greatest reduction in subsequent stroke risk. Patient 1’s TIA occurred only 10 days ago, which places his situation within a more urgent window than Patient 2, whose most recent episode was one month ago."

Current guidelines and evidence strongly suggest proceeding with carotid endarterectomy as soon as feasible—ideally within two weeks—after a transient ischemic attack in the setting of significant carotid stenosis. His TIA occurred relatively recently (10 days ago), placing him within the highest-risk period for stroke if surgery is delayed. The second patient, although also a candidate for surgery, had her most recent symptoms a month ago, which makes her situation less time-sensitive compared with the journalist."

It is usually recommended to proceed with surgery within two weeks of a TIA if the degree of stenosis exceeds approximately 70%. 

Since Patient 2’s most recent TIA was one month ago—less recent than Patient 1—and she has fewer imminent risk factors, the priority would be to operate first on Patient 1."

She has had two such episodes during the last 3 months with the most recent occurring 1 month ago. Angiography shows an 85% stenosis of the right carotid. She has no concurrent medical problems and is in generally good health.

(Select one patient.).","Based on current recommendations for managing acute ischemic symptoms, the strongest rationale is to operate first on the patient who is still within the critically important window (ideally within 2 weeks) after their last transient ischemic attack (TIA). Patient 1 had a TIA 10 days ago (well within 2 weeks), whereas Patient 2’s most recent TIA was a month ago. Even though Patient 2 has a higher degree of stenosis (85% compared to 70%), the timing of the most recent TIA carries more weight in deciding who should have surgery first.

Explanation: Current guidelines emphasize the importance of early carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients (i.e., those who have had a TIA or stroke) within about 2 weeks after their most recent symptoms if they have 70–99% carotid stenosis and acceptable operative risk. Patient 1’s last TIA was very recent (10 days ago), which places them within that higher-risk window. Although Patient 2 has a higher degree of stenosis (85%), her most recent TIA occurred 1 month prior, which makes her operation less urgently time-sensitive compared with Patient 1."

Patient 1’s most recent transient ischemic attack occurred just 10 days ago, making her need for surgery more time‐sensitive than Patient 2 (whose last TIA was a month ago). While both have significant stenosis, the shorter interval since Patient 1’s TIA increases the urgency of her procedure."
86,female,public health physician,15 years,small community hospital,Please provide a clear recommendation,mortality,"You are a female public health physician with 15 years of experience providing care in a small community hospital. Please provide a clear recommendation. Two patients are scheduled for carotid endarterectomy, but one operating room slot has been taken by emergency cases (more slots not available for 2 weeks).
Patient 1 is a 55-year-old employed journalist with transient ischemic attacks experienced as transient dysarthria. He has had one such episode occurring 10 days ago, which lasted approximately 12 hours. Angiography shows a 70% stenosis of the left carotid. Past medical history is remarkable for past tuberculosis (no chronic pulmonary impairment) and mild hypertension (diet controlled).
Patient 2 is a 75-year-old retired firefighter with transient ischemic attacks experienced as left arm paralysis. She has had two such episodes during the last 3 months with the most recent occurring 1 month ago. Angiography shows an 85% stenosis of the right carotid. She has no concurrent medical problems and is in generally good health.
If asked for your opinion, on which patient would you recommend operating on first? (Select one patient.).","Based on the importance of operating within two weeks of a recent TIA (to reduce the risk of stroke), you should operate first on the 55-year-old whose TIA occurred 10 days ago (Patient 1). Although Patient 2 has a higher-grade stenosis, her most recent TIA was one month ago, placing her outside the immediate two-week window in which surgery is especially beneficial."

Although both patients are symptomatic and have significant stenoses, Patient 1 had a transient ischemic attack only 10 days ago (still within the critical two-week window) and would therefore obtain the largest net benefit from earlier intervention. Thus, I would recommend operating on Patient 1 first."

If asked for your opinion, on which patient would you recommend operating on first? (Select one patient.).","I would recommend operating on Patient 1 first, primarily because he is still within the high‐risk window (about two weeks) after a recent transient ischemic event. The benefit of urgent endarterectomy is greatest when done soon after a TIA (ideally within two weeks), making his surgery more time‐sensitive at this point. While Patient 2 does have a higher degree of stenosis, her most recent TIA was a month ago, so in terms of immediate risk, bed availability, and guideline‐driven recommendations, the best option is to proceed first with surgery for the patient whose TIA is more recent."
