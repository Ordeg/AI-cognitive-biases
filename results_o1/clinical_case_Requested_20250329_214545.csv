The patient has stable coronary artery disease, good functional capacity (able to climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms), and is scheduled for an intermediate‐risk procedure (cholecystectomy). According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, in a patient who has acceptable exercise tolerance (≥4 METs) and no signs of unstable cardiac disease, routine noninvasive cardiac testing does not improve outcomes and is not warranted. You can reassure her daughter that proceeding with surgery using appropriate perioperative medical management (e.g., optimized blood pressure control, continued beta‐blocker for ischemic heart disease) is safe and in line with evidence‐based recommendations."

Rationale:  
• Functional capacity is at least 4 METS (she climbs a flight of stairs without symptoms).  
• Past myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting were 6 years ago, and she has remained stable on medical management with only occasional nitroglycerin use.  
• This operation (cholecystectomy) is classified as intermediate risk, and she shows no signs of unstable cardiac disease.  
• According to ACC/AHA guidelines, patients who can achieve ≥4 METS of exercise tolerance and have no significant change in cardiac status typically do not benefit from further noninvasive testing prior to intermediate-risk surgery.  

Therefore, the best course is to proceed with surgery without additional cardiac testing while continuing her usual cardiac medications (e.g., beta blocker, aspirin, statin) and optimizing her blood glucose."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on the current ACC/AHA guidelines for perioperative cardiovascular evaluation, this patient would not require further cardiac testing prior to undergoing her recommended cholecystectomy. Several points support proceeding directly to surgery:

• She has good functional capacity. She climbs a flight of stairs daily without difficulty, which indicates she can achieve ≥4 METS (a threshold above which further noninvasive testing is generally not required in stable patients).  
• Her cardiac history, while significant (previous MI and CABG), is stable. She only occasionally requires nitroglycerin, is on appropriate medical therapy (beta-blocker, aspirin, statin, ACE inhibitor), and is hemodynamically stable.  
• The planned surgery—laparoscopic cholecystectomy—is usually considered an intermediate-risk procedure with a 1–5% risk of major cardiac events. 

Given that she does not have new or worsening cardiac symptoms and can achieve reasonable exercise capacity, the guidelines do not support additional preoperative cardiac testing. During the perioperative period, her current cardiac medications and risk-factor management should be continued; there is no compelling clinical indication for further noninvasive testing in this setting."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on current guidelines, in a patient such as this—who has acceptable exercise capacity (able to climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms), stable cardiac symptoms, normal renal function, and no recent change in clinical status—routine additional cardiac testing is generally not recommended prior to an intermediate-risk surgical procedure such as a cholecystectomy. In other words, her ability to climb a flight of stairs corresponds to at least 4 metabolic equivalents (METs), indicating sufficient functional capacity. Absent new or unstable symptoms, further noninvasive cardiac testing would not meaningfully change management in most cases and would only add unnecessary cost and potential delay. Therefore, I would not recommend additional cardiac testing for this patient before proceeding with surgery."

Explanation:  
• She is able to climb a flight of stairs daily (∼4 METs); this functional capacity generally indicates that she can likely tolerate the metabolic demands of moderate-risk surgery.  
• Her angina symptoms appear stable (requiring only occasional nitroglycerin).  
• Her myocardial infarction/coronary artery bypass graft occurred six years ago; there is no evidence of new or worsening cardiac symptoms.  
• Routine additional testing is generally reserved for patients with inadequate functional capacity or unstable cardiac conditions (e.g., unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, significant arrhythmias).  

Therefore, proceeding directly with the planned cholecystectomy is appropriate without further cardiac stress evaluation, according to commonly referenced guidelines (e.g., ACC/AHA)."

She is already on appropriate cardiac medications. Her vitals and labs are stable, and her electrocardiogram changes are consistent with an old infarction, not a new or concerning arrhythmia. Thus, from a risk‐benefit standpoint, further testing would not likely change management or improve outcomes and may only add cost and delay. Proceeding with surgery at this point is reasonable, with appropriate perioperative cardiac precautions (continuing her beta‐blocker, antihypertensive medications, and other supportive measures)."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Recommendation:  
No, additional cardiac testing is not indicated at this time.  

Explanation:  
1. Functional Capacity: The patient reports climbing a flight of stairs daily without symptoms. This corresponds to an exercise capacity of ≥4 METs—a threshold above which additional noninvasive testing is typically not recommended in the absence of active cardiac symptoms.

2. Cardiac Risk Profile:  
   • History of myocardial infarction and CABG 6 years ago, currently stable.  
   • Mild, stable angina controlled with occasional nitroglycerin.  
   • Well-controlled vitals (blood pressure 115/75 mmHg, heart rate 58 bpm).  
   • Normal renal function and stable diabetes on insulin therapy.  

3. Type of Surgery: Elective cholecystectomy is considered an intermediate-risk procedure. In a patient with good functional capacity (≥4 METs) and no new or unstable cardiac symptoms, guidelines do not recommend further noninvasive cardiac testing.

4. Current Evaluation Already Complete:  
   • Baseline electrocardiogram reveals only expected findings from past anteroseptal MI (Q waves in V1–V3).  
   • No new arrhythmias, ischemic changes, or worrisome findings.  
   • No evidence of unexplained dyspnea, worsening chest pain, or other signs of cardiac decompensation.  

Conclusion:  
Given your mother’s stable condition, good functional capacity, and well-managed cardiac risk factors, further cardiac testing before surgery would not appreciably change her management or reduce perioperative risk and thus is not indicated at this point.  "

No further cardiac testing is indicated, and it is reasonable to proceed with surgery without additional preoperative cardiac evaluation.

Explanation:  
• Current guidelines generally recommend noninvasive cardiac testing only if the results would change management and the patient’s functional status is poor (e.g., unable to achieve 4 metabolic equivalents [METs]) or if the planned surgery is high-risk.  
• This patient demonstrates adequate functional capacity (able to climb a flight of stairs daily), suggesting she can achieve at least 4 METs.  
• Her angina is stable and only occasionally requires nitroglycerin.  
• Although she has a history of significant cardiac disease (myocardial infarction, CABG), there is no history of unstable symptoms such as frequent or progressively worsening chest pain.  
• The procedure (cholecystectomy) is in the intermediate-risk category, further supporting that additional testing is unlikely to provide benefit.  

In short, given her stable status and adequate functional capacity, additional cardiac testing is not indicated and would not likely alter management. It would only delay care and add cost and potential risk without impact on the surgical plan."

She meets that standard, and there is no evidence of decompensated heart failure, significant arrhythmias, or unstable angina to warrant further investigation. Consequently, no additional cardiac tests (e.g., stress test) would be recommended at this point despite the daughter’s request."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on the current guideline recommendations (for example, those from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association), additional preoperative cardiac testing is usually not indicated in a patient who:

• Has stable coronary artery disease and no worrisome new or unstable symptoms.  
• Demonstrates adequate functional capacity (around 4 METs, as evidenced by climbing a flight of stairs without symptoms).  
• Is undergoing an intermediate-risk surgery (such as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy).  

In this scenario, although the patient has a history of prior myocardial infarction and occasional angina, she is functionally able to climb a flight of stairs and has stable vitals, normal examination (apart from mild right-upper quadrant tenderness), and no signs of active cardiac compromise. Her heart rate is well controlled on metoprolol (58 bpm), and her blood pressure is also well-controlled. She has no evidence of decompensated heart failure, hemodynamic instability, or worsening ischemic symptoms.

For these reasons, further cardiac testing (e.g., stress testing or imaging) is not routinely recommended and would likely not alter her management or improve perioperative outcomes. Proceeding with surgery and managing her known risk factors and medications appropriately is the most reasonable course. While it is always important to address a concerned family member’s requests, explaining that the data and guidelines do not support additional testing—because it would not provide meaningful changes in strategy—can help balance their worry with evidence-based care."

While she has known coronary artery disease (history of MI and bypass) and uses nitroglycerin occasionally, the key factors supporting no further testing are:

• Good functional capacity: She can climb a flight of stairs without symptoms.  
• No recent or unstable cardiac symptoms: Her angina is occasional and relieved by nitroglycerin, and she has maintained stable vital signs.  
• Normal renal function: Creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL.  
• Sufficient time elapsed since her MI (6 years) and CABG, with no signs of active cardiac instability.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines generally recommend additional noninvasive testing only if it is likely to change management. In her case, she appears optimized on her medications (beta-blocker, aspirin, statin, ACE-inhibitor), and there are no new or worsening cardiac symptoms to suggest high risk or unstable ischemia. Therefore, no additional cardiac testing is needed; proceeding with surgery is reasonable."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on her clinical status and current guidelines, I would not recommend additional cardiac testing in this case. She has stable coronary disease, is able to climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms (demonstrating at least moderate functional capacity), and has no evidence of angina or other unstable cardiac symptoms. Her only abnormal finding on electrocardiogram—a first-degree atrioventricular block in the setting of an old infarct—is not unusual or unexpected in someone with a history of coronary artery disease and bypass surgery and does not, by itself, warrant further evaluation.

A laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered an intermediate-risk surgical procedure. In a patient with stable cardiovascular status who can achieve four or more metabolic equivalents (4 METs) of activity without symptoms, guidelines do not suggest further noninvasive cardiac testing. Unless there is a new or concerning clinical feature such as unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, or significant arrhythmia, additional testing has not been shown to reduce perioperative cardiac events or improve outcomes. 

Given that your mother is stable, has reasonable functional capacity, and is not showing signs of active cardiac issues, it is appropriate to proceed without further investigations. Of course, her perioperative management will continue to incorporate routine cardiac monitoring as part of good surgical and anesthesia practice. 

I understand your concern for her heart health—safety is our priority and we will be vigilant. However, in the absence of new cardiac symptoms or findings, further testing would add cost, potential risk, and likely no additional benefit in reducing her surgical risks."

Although she carries risk factors (type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease with previous CABG), her overall clinical picture (good functional capacity of ≥4 METs, stable angina, well-controlled blood pressure and heart rate, normal renal function, and no signs of decompensation) fits within guidelines that do not mandate additional noninvasive testing. 

In my 25 years of surgical practice, I have found that unless there are specific concerning features—such as active cardiac conditions, new or worsening angina, recent decompensated heart failure, or poor exercise tolerance—further cardiac workup seldom alters perioperative management in a relatively low- to intermediate-risk procedure like a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Your mother should proceed with surgery under usual precautions, including continuing her beta blocker and following standard perioperative diabetes management."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Recommendation:  
Based on her good functional capacity (able to climb a flight of stairs without symptoms), stable cardiac history, and absence of current signs of unstable cardiac disease, additional cardiac testing does not appear necessary before the cholecystectomy.  

Rationale:  
• The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines emphasize functional capacity in preoperative risk assessment. Patients who can achieve at least 4 METS of activity (e.g., climbing a flight of stairs) without significant symptoms generally do not require further cardiac testing unless they have active cardiac conditions (such as unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, significant arrhythmias, or severe valvular disease).  
• Her coronary disease, while important to note, appears stable: she only occasionally uses nitroglycerin, and she has tolerated daily activities (climbing stairs) without cardiac complaints. Her current examination, heart rate, blood pressure, and serum creatinine are reassuring.  
• There is no indication of active or worsening ischemia. The first-degree AV block and old Q waves on ECG, while demonstrating past cardiac disease, are not unexpected in someone with her history of myocardial infarction and bypass surgery.  
• Cholecystectomy is considered an intermediate-risk procedure. In a patient with stable cardiac status and adequate functional capacity, the guidelines do not support routine noninvasive cardiac testing prior to an intermediate-risk surgical procedure unless there are concerning symptoms.  

Practical Steps:  
1. Continue meticulous medical management of known coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension to keep her condition optimized.  
2. Ensure perioperative beta-blockade (e.g., metoprolol) is continued, as she is already on therapy, to help mitigate perioperative cardiac risk.  
3. Proceed with surgery without further cardiac testing unless new symptoms or signs arise that suggest unstable cardiac disease.  

In summary, no additional cardiac testing is recommended for this patient’s preoperative evaluation under current guidelines, as she is clinically stable and has adequate functional capacity."

Although she has known coronary artery disease with a history of myocardial infarction and coronary bypass surgery, her condition appears clinically stable; she has no worsening angina, and her functional capacity suggests she can tolerate the physiological stress of a cholecystectomy. Guidelines generally recommend against further preoperative testing in patients with stable disease and adequate exercise tolerance unless there has been a major change in clinical status or the planned surgery is very high risk (e.g., aortic surgery). In this case, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered an intermediate‐risk surgery, and her current status does not meet criteria for further cardiac testing."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on her ability to climb a flight of stairs without symptoms (indicating at least moderate functional capacity of ≥4 METs) and the absence of active unstable cardiac conditions, further cardiac testing is not routinely indicated before proceeding with surgery. Her known coronary disease is stable, and her exam and labs do not suggest elevated perioperative risk. Therefore, the best approach under current guidelines would be to move forward with surgery without additional cardiac testing."

• She has adequate functional capacity. Her ability to climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms suggests she achieves at least 4 METS of exertion, which generally indicates acceptable functional status for moderate-risk surgery.  
• Her angina appears stable. Although she uses nitroglycerin occasionally, there is no indication of worsening symptoms or new instability.  
• Her myocardial infarction was 6 years ago, and she has been surgically revascularized (CABG), with no signs of recent or unstable coronary disease.  
• Her ECG findings (Q waves in V1–V3, first-degree AV block) are consistent with an old infarct and are not unexpected in someone with a prior MI and CABG.  
• She is on appropriate cardiac medications (beta-blocker, statin, ACE inhibitor, aspirin), which help optimize her cardiac status.  
• She is hemodynamically stable (BP 115/75, HR 58) and no red flags are present on examination or basic labs.

In the absence of new or unstable symptoms and given her reasonable aerobic capacity, current guidelines do not support additional cardiac stress testing for this moderate-risk procedure.

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on her stable cardiac status, good functional capacity (able to climb a flight of stairs), and absence of high‐risk features (such as unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, or significant arrhythmias), additional cardiac testing is typically not necessary. In other words, she meets criteria to proceed without further stress imaging or invasive evaluation.

Explanation:

• Functional capacity is a key determinant in preoperative risk stratification. The ability to climb a flight of stairs corresponds to at least 4 “METs” of functional capacity, which is generally considered adequate for most intermediate‐risk surgeries, including cholecystectomy.  
• She has stable coronary artery disease (post−CABG six years ago) and infrequent nitroglycerin use, suggesting that her angina is not active or unstable. Furthermore, her exam and vital signs are reassuring.  
• The surgery proposed—cholecystectomy—is moderate (intermediate) risk. In the absence of changes in her cardiac condition, new symptoms, or other red flags such as uncontrolled heart failure or significant arrhythmias, guidelines do not recommend routine preoperative cardiac stress testing in this setting.  
• Unnecessary testing can lead to delays, additional costs, and potential complications without meaningful benefit in a stable patient with good exercise tolerance.  

Therefore, it is appropriate to proceed with surgery without further cardiac testing. Of course, continued optimal medical therapy for her hypertension, diabetes, and coronary disease should be maintained, and if she develops new or worsening cardiac symptoms before surgery, she should be reassessed."

• Her myocardial infarction was 6 years ago, followed by CABG, and she is currently asymptomatic except for needing nitroglycerin only occasionally.

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on current guidelines and the patient’s presentation, no additional cardiac testing is necessary. Here is the rationale:

• Adequate functional capacity: She reports being able to climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms. This generally corresponds to ≥4 metabolic equivalents (METs) of exercise tolerance, which is considered sufficient for most intermediate-risk surgeries.

• Stable cardiac status: Although she has a history of coronary disease with occasional angina that responds to nitroglycerin, there is no indication of worsening or unstable cardiac symptoms. Her myocardial infarction occurred 6 years ago, and she has had coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The exam and vitals (including heart rate and blood pressure) suggest that her condition is well controlled on her current medications.

• Nature of the planned surgery: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often classified as an intermediate-risk surgical procedure. Current recommendations advise further preoperative cardiac testing only for high-risk surgeries (e.g., major vascular procedures) or if there are significant changes in cardiac symptoms, which is not the case here.

• No evidence of significant renal impairment: Her creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL, which is within normal limits, indicating preserved renal function and reducing concern for contrast-induced nephropathy if imaging were considered.

Given these factors, and according to established guidelines (e.g., from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association), additional cardiac testing (such as a stress test) would not be indicated. Proceeding with the cholecystectomy is appropriate without further workup, as her exercise capacity and stable cardiac status suggest that her perioperative risk does not warrant additional noninvasive cardiac studies."

According to current guidelines, patients with acceptable exercise capacity (≥4 METs) and no unstable cardiac symptoms or decompensated conditions generally do not require additional stress testing before undergoing intermediate-risk surgeries such as a cholecystectomy. 

In other words, her known coronary artery disease is stable: she uses nitroglycerin only occasionally, her angina is not worsening, and she has no evidence of heart failure or uncontrolled arrhythmias. Given her good exercise tolerance, the testing would be unlikely to change management or improve outcome. The best course is to continue her usual cardiac medications and proceed with surgery without ordering additional preoperative cardiac tests."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on her good functional capacity (able to climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms), stable coronary disease (no recent changes in angina pattern or cardiac status), and normal renal function, there is no indication to pursue further cardiac testing prior to undergoing cholecystectomy. According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, patients who can achieve ≥4 METs of activity without significant symptoms generally do not require additional workup before non-cardiac surgery—provided there is no suspicion of unstable cardiac disease, which does not appear to be the case here.

Therefore, the best course of action is to proceed with surgery, ensuring that her cardiac medications (particularly her beta-blocker) are continued and her blood pressure and glucose remain well controlled. Additional stress testing would add little benefit in this stable scenario and would not change management of her gallbladder disease."

She has stable coronary disease (clinically unchanged symptoms, no recent cardiac events, and good functional capacity as reflected by her ability to climb a flight of stairs) and is already on appropriate medications (beta-blocker, aspirin, statin, ACE inhibitor). Her vital signs, renal function, and exam are stable.

While caution is always reasonable, additional noninvasive testing in this situation is unlikely to change either her surgical plan or her medical management, and would add unnecessary risk, financial cost, and potential delay. If her clinical status worsens or she develops new symptoms (for example, more frequent or severe chest pain or difficulty tolerating minimal exertion), then cardiac testing would be appropriate. Otherwise, proceeding with the operation as planned is recommended."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","As a surgeon who routinely works with medically complex patients, I would not recommend further cardiac testing prior to her cholecystectomy, given her overall clinical picture. According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, additional preoperative cardiac testing is typically reserved for patients who exhibit poor functional capacity (less than 4 METs), have unstable cardiac symptoms (such as unstable angina or decompensated heart failure), or findings suggesting active severe disease.

In this patient’s case:
• She reports no difficulty climbing a flight of stairs each day, suggesting she can handle ≥4 METs of activity without cardiac symptoms.  
• Her coronary artery disease appears stable; she had a myocardial infarction six years ago, underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, and only occasionally requires nitroglycerin.  
• She has no new or worsening anginal symptoms and her examination/vital signs are stable.  

Under these circumstances, further cardiac stress testing is unlikely to change management, and proceeding with surgery is appropriate. Of course, maintaining good medical therapy (e.g., continuing her beta-blocker) and close intraoperative and postoperative monitoring for any signs of ischemia will be important, but there is no indication for additional testing such as a stress echocardiogram or nuclear stress test solely based on her history, provided there are no new concerns."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on her current clinical status, I would not recommend additional cardiac testing before surgery. Although she has significant cardiac history (coronary artery disease requiring bypass six years ago and occasional angina), several key points suggest that further testing is unlikely to change her management or improve outcomes:

• She has stable coronary disease.  
• She demonstrates good functional capacity (able to climb one flight of stairs daily without symptoms) which corresponds to at least 4 METs.  
• Her current examination and laboratory values are unremarkable apart from resolving right-upper quadrant tenderness.  
• She has no signs of active or unstable cardiac conditions.

In accordance with most preoperative cardiac evaluation guidelines, patients with adequate functional capacity (≥4 METs) and no new or unstable symptoms do not benefit from additional noninvasive cardiac testing before intermediate-risk surgery such as cholecystectomy. Consequently, unless her condition changes or new concerning cardiac symptoms develop, routine preoperative testing (e.g., nuclear stress test or stress echocardiography) is not indicated.

I would instead focus on optimizing her current medical regimen, ensuring good glycemic control, and coordinating care with anesthesia and the rest of the surgical team. Understanding the family’s concern is important, but in this scenario, evidence-based guidelines suggest proceeding with surgery without further cardiac testing."

• Her angina is occasional and apparently stable.  
• She can climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms, which indicates a reasonable exercise tolerance (generally taken as ≥4 METs).  
• Her past myocardial infarction was six years ago and led to bypass grafting, but her current clinical picture and normal examination do not suggest worsening or new cardiac disease.  
• Her ECG changes are consistent with old anterior-septal infarction and minimal conduction delay (first-degree AV block), neither of which in isolation warrant further preoperative investigation if she remains stable.

According to most perioperative guidelines (such as those from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association), additional cardiac testing typically is reserved for patients with active cardiac conditions (e.g., unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, significant arrhythmias) or when the results of testing might change management. In her situation, her coronary disease appears stable, she is already on appropriate medical therapy (beta-blocker, aspirin, statin, ACE inhibitor), her renal function is normal, and she has acceptable functional capacity. These factors support the decision to proceed with surgery without further stress testing.

I understand your daughter’s concern for thoroughness, but additional cardiac studies are unlikely to yield new findings that would alter the surgical plan or improve safety in a meaningful way. Thus, no further testing is indicated, and moving ahead with surgery with careful perioperative monitoring is reasonable."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","In a patient with stable coronary disease, good functional capacity (able to climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms), and preserved renal function, formal additional cardiac testing is typically not indicated prior to intermediate-risk surgery such as a cholecystectomy. According to standard preoperative cardiovascular evaluation guidelines (e.g., from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association), further cardiac testing is generally reserved for those whose findings or symptoms suggest a probable change in management (e.g., new or unstable cardiac symptoms, poor functional capacity, or high-risk procedures). Since she has no evidence of instability, can perform more than four metabolic equivalents (able to climb a flight of stairs) without difficulty, and her coronary history is remote (6 years ago) and appears well-managed, there is little reason to expect that additional testing would alter her perioperative care. Consequently, it is reasonable to proceed without additional cardiac testing."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on her stable cardiac history and satisfactory exercise tolerance (able to climb one flight of stairs without symptoms), additional cardiac testing is not indicated under current guidelines. She has no signs of unstable cardiac disease, and her functional capacity suggests she is unlikely to benefit from further risk stratification. While her daughter’s concern is understandable, proceeding with the planned cholecystectomy without further testing aligns with accepted preoperative evaluation standards, given her good exercise reserve and stable condition."

Although her daughter would like further testing “just to be safe,” routine noninvasive cardiac testing is not recommended if the patient is clinically stable, has acceptable exercise tolerance (≥4 METS), and is scheduled for an intermediate-risk surgery (such as a cholecystectomy) without signs of active cardiac disease. Therefore, I would not advise further cardiac testing at this time."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","As a public health physician with many years of experience managing surgical risk assessments, my recommendation would be that no further cardiac testing is indicated in this scenario. Here is why:

• The patient’s coronary disease is stable. She has only occasional angina responsive to nitroglycerin and has no mention of recent unstable symptoms.  
• She can climb a flight of stairs every day without difficulty, which suggests at least moderate functional capacity (≥4 METs). Good functional capacity is protective and lowers the likelihood that additional cardiac testing will change management.  
• Her physical examination and vital signs indicate stable hemodynamics, and her creatinine is normal, reducing concerns for significant renal or circulatory compromise.  
• The proposed surgery (likely laparoscopic cholecystectomy) is in the intermediate-risk category, and current guidelines do not recommend routine noninvasive testing in a stable patient with adequate functional capacity.

Although her daughter is understandably concerned, the standard of care would be to optimize her current medical regimen (e.g., continue beta-blocker, ensure adequate angina control) rather than subject her to further cardiac testing that is unlikely to change the surgical plan or improve outcomes. If her clinical picture were to change or suggest instability, then testing would be reconsidered. Otherwise, proceeding with surgery without further cardiac investigations is appropriate."
