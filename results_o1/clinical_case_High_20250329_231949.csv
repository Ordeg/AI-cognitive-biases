4,male,family physician,15 years,large academic hospital,Please provide a probability estimate,mortality,"You are a male family physician with 15 years of experience providing care in a large academic hospital. Please provide a probability estimate. You are working in a college medical clinic that can offer a screening test for a viral disease. The test was originally developed years ago in a different setting and reported as excellent. Specifically, among 100 students who have the disease, the test is correctly positive in ninety-five, and falsely negative in only five. In contrast, among 100 students who do not have the disease, the test is correctly negative in ninety-five, and falsely positive in only five. On average, about one in four students are infected but without symptoms.
In this context, consider MJ who is a 21-year-old engineering student who has no symptoms. It is now mid-term season. She has a family history of depression and suicide. MJ likes to eat apples and oranges. MJ is worried about possible infection since her roommate tested positive. You doubt MJ has the viral disease. You also have doubts that the test accuracy was exaggerated in the original report. You know your college is special so that statistical probabilities might not apply to unique patients. If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease? (Answer as a percentage.).","First, note these pieces of information:  
• The overall prevalence among students is 25% (one in four).  
• The sensitivity of the test (probability of a positive test if infected) is 95%.  
• The specificity of the test (probability of a negative test if not infected) is 95%. Thus, the false-positive rate is 5%.  

Use Bayes’ Theorem:  
P(Disease | Positive) = [P(Positive | Disease) × P(Disease)] /  
                       [P(Positive | Disease) × P(Disease) + P(Positive | Not Disease) × P(Not Disease)].  

Here:  
• P(Disease) = 0.25, so P(Not Disease) = 0.75.  
• P(Positive | Disease) = 0.95.  
• P(Positive | Not Disease) = 1 − Specificity = 0.05.  

Plugging in the numbers:  
P(Disease | Positive) = (0.95 × 0.25) / [(0.95 × 0.25) + (0.05 × 0.75)]  
                      = 0.2375 / (0.2375 + 0.0375)  
                      = 0.2375 / 0.275  
                      ≈ 0.86 (i.e., 86%).  

Therefore, if MJ’s test result is positive, the probability she has the viral disease is about 86%."

If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease? (Answer as a percentage.).","First, note the key information given:

• Prevalence (p) of the disease in this student population: 25% (i.e., 0.25)  
• Sensitivity (Se): 95% (i.e., 0.95)  
  – If a student has the disease, the test is positive 95% of the time.  
• Specificity (Sp): 95% (i.e., 0.95)  
  – If a student does not have the disease, the test is negative 95% of the time.  

We seek the probability MJ actually has the disease given a positive test (the positive predictive value, PPV). The usual Bayesian formula for PPV is:

PPV = (Se × p) / [(Se × p) + ((1 − Sp) × (1 − p))]

Plugging in the numbers:

• Se × p = 0.95 × 0.25 = 0.2375  
• (1 − Sp) × (1 − p) = 0.05 × 0.75 = 0.0375  

Therefore,

PPV = 0.2375 / (0.2375 + 0.0375)  
    = 0.2375 / 0.275  
    ≈ 0.8636  (which is about 86%)

So, if MJ’s test is positive, the probability she actually has the viral disease is about 86%."

You also have doubts that the test accuracy was exaggerated in the original report. You know your college is special so that statistical probabilities might not apply to unique patients. If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease? (Answer as a percentage.).","First, note the basic information needed for Bayesian analysis:

• Sensitivity (probability the test is positive if the person truly has the disease) = 95%  
• Specificity (probability the test is negative if the person truly does not have the disease) = 95%  
• Prevalence (probability a randomly selected student—MJ, in this case—actually has the disease) = 25%  

Here is how to compute the probability that MJ truly has the disease given a positive test (using Bayes’ Theorem):

1) Let D = “MJ has the disease” and T+ = “The test is positive.”  
2) P(D) = 0.25 (prevalence).  
3) P(not D) = 1 − 0.25 = 0.75.

4) Sensitivity = P(T+ | D) = 0.95.  
5) Then, the false-positive rate = 1 − Specificity = 1 − 0.95 = 0.05. So, P(T+ | not D) = 0.05.

6) P(T+) = P(T+ | D) ⋅ P(D) + P(T+ | not D) ⋅ P(not D)  
          = (0.95 × 0.25) + (0.05 × 0.75)  
          = 0.2375 + 0.0375  
          = 0.2750.

7) By Bayes’ Theorem,

             = (0.95 × 0.25) / 0.275

42,male,public health physician,15 years,solo practice setting,Please provide a probability estimate,mortality,"You are a male public health physician with 15 years of experience providing care in a solo practice setting. Please provide a probability estimate. You are working in a college medical clinic that can offer a screening test for a viral disease. The test was originally developed years ago in a different setting and reported as excellent. Specifically, among 100 students who have the disease, the test is correctly positive in ninety-five, and falsely negative in only five. In contrast, among 100 students who do not have the disease, the test is correctly negative in ninety-five, and falsely positive in only five. On average, about one in four students are infected but without symptoms.
In this context, consider MJ who is a 21-year-old engineering student who has no symptoms. It is now mid-term season. She has a family history of depression and suicide. MJ likes to eat apples and oranges. MJ is worried about possible infection since her roommate tested positive. You doubt MJ has the viral disease. You also have doubts that the test accuracy was exaggerated in the original report. You know your college is special so that statistical probabilities might not apply to unique patients. If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease? (Answer as a percentage.).","First, note the test characteristics reported in the original setting:  
• Sensitivity (true‐positive rate): 95%  
• Specificity (true‐negative rate): 95%  

In other words:  
• P(+ | Disease) = 0.95  
• P(− | No Disease) = 0.95 → P(+ | No Disease) = 0.05  

Next, the prevalence among asymptomatic students is about 1 in 4 (i.e., 25%). We denote:  
• P(Disease) = 0.25  
• P(No Disease) = 0.75  

Using Bayes’ theorem, the probability that MJ actually has the disease given a positive test is:  

P(Disease | +) = [P(Disease) × P(+ | Disease)] / [P(Disease) × P(+ | Disease) + P(No Disease) × P(+ | No Disease)]  

Plugging in the numbers:  

= [0.25 × 0.95] / [0.25 × 0.95 + 0.75 × 0.05]  
= 0.2375 / (0.2375 + 0.0375)

• Of the 25 who have the disease, 95% test positive → 23.75 (roughly 24) true positives.  
• Of the 75 who do not have the disease, 5% test positive → 3.75 (roughly 4) false positives.  

Hence, a positive test could be from either the 24 true positives or the 4 false positives, for a total of 28 positives. Thus, the probability that a person who tests positive is truly infected is about 24 ÷ (24 + 4) = 24 ÷ 28 ≈ 86%.

59,female,general internist,15 years,small community hospital,Please provide a probability estimate,mortality,"You are a female general internist with 15 years of experience providing care in a small community hospital. Please provide a probability estimate. You are working in a college medical clinic that can offer a screening test for a viral disease. The test was originally developed years ago in a different setting and reported as excellent. Specifically, among 100 students who have the disease, the test is correctly positive in ninety-five, and falsely negative in only five. In contrast, among 100 students who do not have the disease, the test is correctly negative in ninety-five, and falsely positive in only five. On average, about one in four students are infected but without symptoms.
In this context, consider MJ who is a 21-year-old engineering student who has no symptoms. It is now mid-term season. She has a family history of depression and suicide. MJ likes to eat apples and oranges. MJ is worried about possible infection since her roommate tested positive. You doubt MJ has the viral disease. You also have doubts that the test accuracy was exaggerated in the original report. You know your college is special so that statistical probabilities might not apply to unique patients. If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease? (Answer as a percentage.).","Let’s use the usual Bayesian approach, which takes into account both the test’s performance and the background prevalence of the disease:

1. Prevalence (probability that a randomly chosen student has the disease): 25% (0.25)
2. Sensitivity (test positive in someone who actually has disease): 95% (0.95)
3. Specificity (test negative in someone who does not have disease): 95% (0.95)
   → False-positive rate = 5% (0.05)

Now compute:  
• Probability that someone both has the disease and tests positive: 0.25 × 0.95 = 0.2375  
• Probability that someone does not have the disease but still tests positive: 0.75 × 0.05 = 0.0375  

Hence, the total probability of a positive test is:  
0.2375 + 0.0375 = 0.275  

Finally, the probability that a test-positive person actually has the disease is:  
0.2375 ÷ 0.275 ≈ 0.8636, or about 86%  

Therefore, if MJ’s test is positive, her likelihood of having the viral disease is around 86%."

• Specificity = 95% (thus false-positive rate = 5% = 0.05), and  
• Prevalence among students = 25% = 0.25,  

we get:

Probability(MJ has disease | test is positive)  
= [Sensitivity × Prevalence] /  
  ([Sensitivity × Prevalence] + [False-positive rate × (1 – Prevalence)])  
= (0.95 × 0.25) /  
  [(0.95 × 0.25) + (0.05 × 0.75)]

• Specificity = 95% (i.e., if a person does not have the disease, the chance the test is negative)  
• Prevalence = 25% (i.e., about one in four are infected)

We want P(disease | positive). Using Bayes’ rule:

P(disease | positive) = [ P(positive | disease) × P(disease) ] /  
                        [ P(positive | disease) × P(disease) + P(positive | no disease) × P(no disease) ]

• P(positive | no disease) = 1 – Specificity = 0.05  
• P(no disease) = 1 – 0.25 = 0.75  

Therefore:

P(disease | positive) = (0.95 × 0.25) / [ (0.95 × 0.25) + (0.05 × 0.75 ) ]

P(Disease | Positive) = [Sensitivity × Prevalence] / ([Sensitivity × Prevalence] + [(1 – Specificity) × (1 – Prevalence)])

If the test’s reported accuracy truly holds (95% sensitivity and 95% specificity) and if one in four students on average is infected (25% prevalence), then the approximate probability that MJ actually has the disease, given a positive test result, can be calculated as follows:

• Let P(D) = probability of having the disease = 0.25  
• Let P(¬D) = probability of not having the disease = 0.75  
• Test sensitivity = P(Positive | D) = 0.95

P(D | Positive) = [P(Positive | D) × P(D)] / ([P(Positive | D) × P(D)] + [P(Positive | ¬D) × P(¬D)])

Rounded to a whole percentage, that is about 86%.

Nonetheless, under the assumptions stated, the probability is about 86%."
