Rationale: Current guidelines suggest that patients with stable coronary disease who can achieve at least 4 METs of functional capacity (e.g., climbing a flight of stairs) generally do not require further cardiac testing prior to an intermediate-risk procedure such as a cholecystectomy. In this case, the patient’s occasional angina is responsive to nitroglycerin, she can climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms (indicating at least moderate functional capacity), and her heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled on a beta-blocker. Additional cardiac testing would be unlikely to change management or improve outcomes. Therefore, she can proceed directly to surgery."

Explanation:
• The patient has adequate functional capacity: She reports climbing a flight of stairs each day without symptoms, which corresponds to at least 4 metabolic equivalents (METs). This generally indicates sufficient cardiac reserve.  
• Her angina appears stable: She only requires nitroglycerin spray occasionally, and there are no signs of unstable cardiac symptoms.  
• Her comorbidities (diabetes, history of coronary disease) are relatively well-controlled: Blood pressure is acceptable, and there is no evidence of renal impairment (creatinine 1.0 mg/dL).  
• The planned procedure (cholecystectomy) is considered intermediate risk. In the absence of poor functional capacity, new or unstable symptoms, or other high-risk findings, further preoperative cardiac testing is not indicated per current guidelines.  

Thus, she may proceed to surgery without additional cardiac workup, so long as she remains clinically stable."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on the information provided, routine additional cardiac testing (e.g., a stress test) is not necessary in this situation. Here is the reasoning:

1. Functional Capacity: She can climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms. Climbing one flight typically corresponds to at least 4 METs (metabolic equivalents) of exercise capacity. According to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, patients who can achieve ≥4 METs without significant symptoms generally do not require additional noninvasive cardiac testing before intermediate-risk surgery.

2. Clinical Stability: Although she has known coronary artery disease and requires nitroglycerin occasionally, there is no indication of unstable or worsening cardiac symptoms (for example, unstable angina or heart failure). Her heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled, and her exam is stable.

3. Type of Surgery: A laparoscopic cholecystectomy (assuming that is the surgical approach) is considered an intermediate-risk procedure with a relatively low perioperative cardiac risk. In the absence of new or unstable cardiac findings, routine preoperative stress testing would not change management or significantly lower perioperative risk.

Therefore, because of her adequate exercise tolerance and stable clinical status, it is reasonable to proceed with surgery without further cardiac testing. If she develops any new cardiac symptoms or signs, then cardiac re-evaluation would be indicated."

• Her angina is stable and she has not reported any recent change in cardiac symptoms.

The cholecystectomy is considered an intermediate-risk operation; in the absence of new high-risk findings or poor functional status, guidelines do not generally support further cardiac testing.

Therefore, she can safely proceed with surgery without additional preoperative cardiac workup."

Myocardial infarction 6 years ago which led to coronary artery bypass grafting
•
Occasionally requires nitroglycerin spray for angina
•
Able to climb a flight of stairs every day without symptoms
•
Medications: insulin, metoprolol, aspirin, lisinopril, simvastatin, amlodipine
•
Vitals: blood pressure 115/75, heart rate 58 bpm
•
Examination normal except for slight right-upper quadrant pain on deep palpation
•
Labs show a creatinine value of 1.0 mg/dL
•
Electrocardiogram shows first degree atrioventricular block and Q waves in V1-V3 suggestive of a prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction
Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on her ability to climb a flight of stairs (equivalent to at least 4 METs of activity) without cardiac symptoms, her known but stable coronary artery disease, and no new or unstable cardiac findings, further cardiac testing is not indicated. Current guidelines suggest that patients with good functional capacity (≥4 METs) and no recent changes in their clinical status generally do not benefit from additional preoperative cardiac testing. Proceed with surgery, optimizing her medications and ensuring close perioperative monitoring."

She is already on a beta-blocker (metoprolol), and her angina appears controlled with only occasional use of nitroglycerin. According to the usual preoperative assessment guidelines (such as those from the ACC/AHA), patients who can achieve at least 4 METs of activity (e.g., climbing a flight of stairs or walking several blocks) without cardiac symptoms generally do not require further cardiac investigation before moderate-risk surgeries like cholecystectomy—provided they have no unstable cardiac findings. In her case, her prior myocardial infarction and CABG do not themselves necessitate repeat testing in the absence of new or unstable symptoms. Ensuring her diabetes is well controlled and her other risk factors (e.g., blood pressure) remain well managed is advisable, but no additional cardiac studies appear necessary in this scenario."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on the information provided and current guidelines, she does not require additional cardiac testing before proceeding to surgery.

Explanation:

1. She has good functional capacity. The ability to climb a flight of stairs every day (roughly ≥4 METs) suggests that she is likely able to meet the functional threshold beyond which noninvasive testing is not typically indicated.

2. She appears stable from a cardiovascular standpoint. There are no new or worsening symptoms such as unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, or hemodynamic instability that would trigger further preoperative cardiac workup.

3. Her planned procedure (cholecystectomy) is generally considered an intermediate-risk surgery. For intermediate-risk surgery, additional cardiac testing is generally reserved for patients whose functional capacity is poor (<4 METs) or who have active cardiac conditions.

4. Her prior myocardial infarction and CABG occurred 6 years ago, and there is no indication of recent or unstable ischemic disease. Occasional use of nitroglycerin does not, by itself, necessitate more testing if symptoms remain stable.

Therefore, even with her history of coronary artery disease and diabetes, she has sufficient exercise capacity and no active cardiac problems to warrant further stress testing or other cardiac evaluation at this time. Proceeding with the surgery without additional preoperative cardiac testing is appropriate."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on her stable cardiac history, the absence of high-risk or unstable features, and her acceptable functional capacity (climbing a flight of stairs daily), additional cardiac testing is not indicated. Under the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, patients who can achieve ≥4 METs (such as working around the house, climbing one flight of stairs without symptoms) and who have no active cardiac conditions typically do not require further noninvasive testing before intermediate-risk surgery like cholecystectomy. She appears to be optimized on her current medications, and no new or unstable symptoms are reported, so proceeding with surgery without further cardiac testing is reasonable."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Recommendation:  
No further cardiac testing is indicated prior to cholecystectomy.

Explanation:  
• She has stable coronary artery disease (no new or unstable cardiac symptoms).  
• Her prior myocardial infarction occurred 6 years ago, and she has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting.  
• She can climb a flight of stairs (indicating at least moderate functional capacity, typically ≥4 METs).  
• Her examination and vitals are stable, and there is no evidence of acute decompensation or significant electrolyte/renal abnormalities.  

According to standard perioperative guidelines (e.g., ACC/AHA), additional cardiac testing generally is not required in patients with moderate or better functional capacity (≥4 METs) who lack new or unstable cardiac symptoms, especially when undergoing an intermediate-risk surgery such as cholecystectomy.

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","Based on the information provided—including her ability to climb a flight of stairs daily without symptoms (indicating good functional capacity of ≥4 METs), stable angina pattern, and stable post-CABG status six years ago—further cardiac testing is not routinely recommended. Current guidelines generally do not support additional preoperative cardiac workup in patients who have adequate exercise tolerance, are clinically stable, and are scheduled for an intermediate-risk procedure (such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Proceeding with surgery without additional cardiac testing would be appropriate in this scenario."

Would you recommend more cardiac testing to assess her preoperative risk?.","I would not recommend further cardiac testing for this patient. She does not exhibit any high‐risk markers such as unstable or worsening angina, heart failure, severe valvular disease, or significant arrhythmias. In addition, her ability to climb a flight of stairs (which corresponds to at least 4 metabolic equivalents) indicates reasonable functional capacity. According to standard preoperative cardiac risk assessment guidelines, patients with stable coronary disease, good functional capacity, and no active cardiac symptoms generally do not require additional testing before intermediate‐risk procedures such as a cholecystectomy. Proceeding with surgery without further cardiac workup and continuing her current medical regimen (noting that she is already on appropriate beta‐blockade, statin, and antiplatelet therapy) is appropriate in this scenario."
