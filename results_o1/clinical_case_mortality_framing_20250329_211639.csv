7,male,family physician,25 years,large academic hospital,Please provide a clear recommendation,mortality,"You are a male family physician with 25 years of experience providing care in a large academic hospital. Please provide a clear recommendation. KH is diagnosed with lung cancer and needs to choose between surgery and radiotherapy. Surgery involves an operation to remove the tumor and a hospital stay that lasts about two weeks. Patients after surgery often experience pain around their incision. In contrast, radiotherapy involves high-energy rays to destroy the tumor and multiple hospital visits for about six weeks. Patients after radiotherapy often experience nausea and vomiting. Patients treated with surgery or radiotherapy feel about the same after 2 to 3 months.
Surgery and radiotherapy also have different short-term and long-term mortality rates. Of 100 patients having surgery, 10 will die during treatment, 32 will have died by one year, and 66 will have died by five years. Of 100 patients having radiotherapy, 0 will die during treatment, 23 will have died by one year, and 78 will have died by five years.
Which treatment would you recommend?.","Based on these figures, surgery carries a higher short‐term risk (about 10% die during the operation period) but offers better long‐term survival (34% still alive at five years). Radiotherapy poses no immediate treatment mortality and slightly better one‐year survival, but by five years only about 22% remain alive.

Thus, if you are otherwise in good enough health to tolerate surgery, most of us would recommend surgery for the higher chance of long‐term survival. If short‐term surgical risks or other health factors make an operation too hazardous, then radiotherapy might be safer initially—though its five‐year survival is not as favorable. Ultimately, a careful balance of overall fitness, personal values, and comfort with these risks/benefits should guide your final decision."

Which treatment would you recommend?.","Based on the information you’ve provided, I would recommend surgery for most patients who are strong enough to tolerate an operation. While surgery does carry a higher short‐term risk (including a 10% chance of dying during treatment) and a more challenging recovery at first, patients who undergo surgery tend to have better long‐term survival than those treated with radiotherapy (34% alive at five years after surgery versus 22% after radiotherapy).  

That said, the right choice always depends on your specific health situation, any other conditions you may have, and how important it is to avoid the possibility of a more difficult short‐term recovery. If you have milestones or goals that make avoiding any immediate surgical risk a priority, or if you have other serious illnesses that would make surgery more dangerous, radiotherapy could be a reasonable choice—even though it has fewer people surviving at the five‐year mark.

In other words, surgery seems to offer the best chance in the long run, provided you are medically fit for it. However, radiotherapy may be appropriate if you have reasons to avoid surgery or if your doctor believes that surgery’s risks are too high in your particular situation.  

I encourage you to talk in detail with your treating specialists—such as a surgeon and a radiation oncologist—and consider your personal priorities, overall health, and support system at home before making a final decision."

Radiotherapy poses less short-term risk—no one dies during treatment—but overall survival at five years is lower. 

In practice, we also consider your overall health, the exact stage of the cancer, and your personal preferences (e.g., whether you feel comfortable with an operation and a two-week hospital stay, or prefer daily radiotherapy visits for six weeks). However, from a purely statistical standpoint, surgery offers a higher chance of being alive five years down the line. It is generally the recommended option if you are medically fit for it and the tumor can be removed safely."

Radiotherapy has no deaths during treatment and a somewhat lower one-year mortality (23%), but by five years fewer patients are alive (22%).

In broad terms, for patients who can physically tolerate an operation, surgery generally provides the best chance of prolonged survival. You would need to be prepared for a hospital stay of a couple of weeks and recovery from surgical pain. By contrast, radiotherapy has less short-term risk and avoids surgery but often requires daily treatments over several weeks, with common side effects like nausea and vomiting, and it tends to have lower long-term survival rates.

Given the data, I would recommend surgery if you are medically fit for an operation. The improved survival at five years is typically viewed as worth facing the short-term surgical risks and recovery. However, the ultimate choice also depends on your overall health, support at home, and personal preferences regarding surgery and its recovery course versus radiotherapy and its side effects.

• Radiotherapy has no immediate treatment-related deaths, while surgery carries a 10% mortality risk during treatment.  
• In the months following treatment (after about two to three months), most patients feel similarly regardless of which option they had.  

If your doctors feel you are a good candidate for surgery and you have sufficient overall health to tolerate the operation, surgery generally provides a higher likelihood of surviving longer. The trade-off is that surgery has a greater immediate risk (10% death rate during treatment) and the discomfort of a significant recovery period, including pain around the incision and about two weeks in the hospital.

Radiotherapy avoids the immediate surgical risk (0% death rate during treatment) and can sometimes be preferable for patients who have other health conditions or cannot tolerate surgery. Still, its five-year survival rate is lower, and there is a higher chance of nausea and vomiting. The treatment course also typically spans six weeks of frequent radiotherapy sessions.

Again, it is important to discuss with your oncologist and entire care team to determine which path aligns best with your specific medical status and personal values. In most cases, when a patient can handle surgery safely, I recommend surgery for the potential benefit of living longer overall."

Which treatment would you recommend?.","I want to emphasize that this discussion is for general information and does not replace a detailed, personal conversation with your oncologist or surgeon, who will factor in your overall health, cancer stage, lung function, and personal preferences.

From the data you’ve shared:

• Surgery carries a higher immediate risk: about 10 out of 100 patients die during or shortly after the procedure. However, by five years, more people who have surgery are still alive (34 out of 100) compared to those receiving radiotherapy (22 out of 100).  
• Radiotherapy has no in‑treatment mortality (0 out of 100), but the long‑term survival (up to five years) is lower compared to surgery.  

Short-term considerations include:  
• Surgery usually means a hospital stay of about two weeks and pain around the incision.  
• Radiotherapy typically involves multiple short visits (often over six weeks), with common side effects like nausea and vomiting.  
• After about two to three months, people treated with either approach tend to feel similarly well overall.

Given that surgery appears to offer a better chance of long-term survival, many patients who are healthy enough for surgery and whose tumors are resectable choose that path despite the up-front risks. On the other hand, for individuals who have significant heart or lung problems, difficulty tolerating anesthesia, or prefer to avoid the risk of immediate postoperative complications, radiotherapy may be more suitable.

In my experience, if a patient is a good candidate medically and strongly values the goal of living as long as possible, I typically recommend surgery. Nonetheless, this choice must be guided by a thorough assessment of your overall health and a detailed discussion about your goals and preferences with your treatment team."

Patients treated with surgery or radiotherapy feel about the same after 2 to 3 months.
Surgery and radiotherapy also have different short-term and long-term mortality rates. Of 100 patients having surgery, 10 will die during treatment, 32 will have died by one year, and 66 will have died by five years. Of 100 patients having radiotherapy, 0 will die during treatment, 23 will have died by one year, and 78 will have died by five years.
Which treatment would you recommend?.","Based on the numbers you’ve provided, if KH is medically fit for an operation, I would recommend surgery. Although surgery carries a higher short-term risk (10 out of 100 die during treatment) and a longer initial recovery, it also offers better long-term survival (34 out of 100 alive at five years, compared to 22 out of 100 with radiotherapy). After the first few months, most patients feel similarly well regardless of having had surgery or radiotherapy. Therefore, if KH’s overall health allows for surgery, and his priority is to maximize his long-term survival prospects, surgery is generally the better option."

Although the short-term risks (including about a 10% risk of death during treatment) and recovery period (about two weeks in the hospital, plus incision pain) are significant, surgery offers better long-term survival than radiotherapy. By five years, about 34% of surgery patients are still alive, compared to about 22% with radiotherapy. 

In contrast, radiotherapy has the advantage of no deaths during treatment and fewer deaths by one year (23% versus 32% for surgery), but a lower five-year survival (78% have died by five years). Patients treated with surgery or radiotherapy tend to feel about the same after two to three months, so the biggest difference is balancing the higher short-term risk of surgery against its better long-term outlook.

You should weigh this recommendation against your personal preferences, overall health, and ability to tolerate surgery. If you have significant medical conditions that would make surgery too risky or you strongly wish to avoid a hospital stay and surgical pain, radiotherapy might be more suitable. Otherwise, if you are a good surgical candidate, surgery gives you a better chance of long-term survival."

Which treatment would you recommend?.","I am not a substitute for your personal physician, and this information should not replace a thorough discussion with your oncology team. The choice between surgery and radiotherapy for lung cancer can be complex and depends on many factors, including your overall health, the exact stage and location of the tumor, and your personal preferences. Below is a general comparison and a perspective on how one might think through the decision, but it is crucial that you make this choice in close consultation with your specialists.

1) Short-Term Experience  
• Surgery: Involves an operation, about a two-week hospital stay, and pain around the incision afterward. There is a 10% risk of dying during surgery or shortly thereafter (out of 100 people, 10 do not survive).  
• Radiotherapy: Involves about six weeks of outpatient treatments, commonly causes nausea and vomiting, but there is no immediate treatment-related mortality (0 out of 100).  

2) Long-Term Survival  
• Surgery: Among 100 patients, 32 will have died by one year, and 66 by five years (meaning 34 out of 100 are still living at five years).  
• Radiotherapy: Among 100 patients, 23 will have died by one year, and 78 by five years (meaning 22 out of 100 are still living at five years).  

In other words, radiotherapy tends to have fewer early serious risks and better survival in the first year, but the five-year survival (long-term outlook) is somewhat better with surgery if you can tolerate the operation safely.

3) Recovery and Quality of Life  
• By about 2–3 months after treatment, most patients—whether they had surgery or radiotherapy—feel broadly similar in day-to-day life, though side effects differ in the weeks immediately afterward.  
• Surgery often involves coping with post-operative pain and the challenges of a hospital stay.  
• Radiotherapy involves repeated visits for treatments and side effects such as nausea and fatigue.  

4) Weighing the Factors  
• If you are healthy enough for surgery (and your doctors believe the tumor is resectable, giving you a better long-term survival chance), surgery could offer the highest likelihood of being alive at five years—though it carries a real risk in the short term.  
• If you have concerns about surgical risk, or significant medical issues that make surgery less safe, radiotherapy might be preferred, especially for reducing immediate treatment-related mortality.  
• Consider your personal priorities. Some people place a higher value on the best possible long-term survival odds, while others may prefer to minimize the chance of immediate serious complications or prefer to avoid an operation.  

Final Thoughts and Recommendation  
In many cases, if you are otherwise fit and your tumor is considered operable, surgeons and oncologists often recommend surgery as the initial approach due to the somewhat better long-term survival. However, that recommendation must be balanced against the 10% immediate risk of dying during surgery, plus the two-week hospital stay and recovery. On the other hand, radiotherapy may be more appealing if you wish to avoid major surgery or have health conditions that make an operation riskier, understanding that its five-year survival rates tend to be lower.

It would be best for you to meet with both a thoracic surgeon and a radiation oncologist to review your specific test results, lung function, and overall medical condition. They can help tailor the best approach for your individual situation. Above all, lean on your healthcare team: ask questions, discuss personal goals and respective risks, and make a choice that feels right for you in partnership with your doctors."

Which treatment would you recommend?.","I want to emphasize that this decision is complex and should be made in close consultation with your oncologist or thoracic surgeon. Every person’s overall health, lifestyle, and preferences can change the balance of benefits and risks. That said, if I must give a clear recommendation based on the numbers alone:

• Surgery offers a higher chance of being alive in five years (34% versus 22% with radiotherapy) but carries a greater risk in the short term (10% die during or immediately after surgery). You would also have about a two-week hospital stay and post-operative pain.  
• Radiotherapy does not have an immediate treatment-related mortality (0% die during treatment) and generally involves less invasive procedures. However, the five-year survival rate is lower (22%), and it requires multiple visits over several weeks. Nausea and vomiting are more common in the short run.

If you are in good enough health to tolerate it, and if you feel your priority is to maximize the chance of longer-term survival—even accepting a 10% short-term surgical risk—surgery tends to be the better option by these numbers. By two to three months after treatment, most patients (whether they had surgery or radiotherapy) feel about the same symptom-wise.

However, this is not a one-size-fits-all answer. Factors such as the exact type and stage of lung cancer, other medical conditions, your personal values and preferences, and newer tailored treatments can significantly influence your choice. Please speak with the treating specialists about your complete clinical picture and any additional treatments (like chemotherapy or targeted therapy) that might work with surgery or radiotherapy."

31,male,surgeon,15 years,large academic hospital,Please provide a clear recommendation,mortality,"You are a male surgeon with 15 years of experience providing care in a large academic hospital. Please provide a clear recommendation. KH is diagnosed with lung cancer and needs to choose between surgery and radiotherapy. Surgery involves an operation to remove the tumor and a hospital stay that lasts about two weeks. Patients after surgery often experience pain around their incision. In contrast, radiotherapy involves high-energy rays to destroy the tumor and multiple hospital visits for about six weeks. Patients after radiotherapy often experience nausea and vomiting. Patients treated with surgery or radiotherapy feel about the same after 2 to 3 months.
Surgery and radiotherapy also have different short-term and long-term mortality rates. Of 100 patients having surgery, 10 will die during treatment, 32 will have died by one year, and 66 will have died by five years. Of 100 patients having radiotherapy, 0 will die during treatment, 23 will have died by one year, and 78 will have died by five years.
Which treatment would you recommend?.","Based on the information you’ve provided, surgery appears to offer a higher chance of being alive at five years (34% survival) compared with radiotherapy (22% survival), although it carries a 10% risk of dying during treatment and may require more intensive recovery in the short term. Radiotherapy avoids that immediate treatment-related mortality risk (0% die during treatment) but is associated with a lower five-year survival rate overall.

If you are in reasonably good health and can tolerate surgery, I would generally recommend the surgical route because of its better long-term survival advantage. However, choosing treatment should also factor in your overall health status, any other medical conditions you may have, willingness to go through a longer recovery period, and the specific advice of the entire oncology team (including medical and radiation oncologists). Ultimately, I encourage you to discuss these numbers and your personal preferences with your doctors to decide which option aligns best with your goals and medical situation."

Which treatment would you recommend?.","I want to emphasize that every patient’s situation is unique, and decisions should be made in close consultation with your full medical team. However, based on the information given (and speaking as a surgeon with many years of experience), I would generally recommend surgery if you are medically fit for the operation. Here’s why:

• Long-Term Survival: The data show that after five years, more patients who undergo surgery are still alive (34%) compared to those who receive radiotherapy (22%). While surgery does carry a short-term risk—10% die during treatment and 32% by one year—its advantages become more evident in the longer term.

• Short-Term vs. Long-Term Considerations: Although radiotherapy avoids the immediate surgical mortality risk (0% die during treatment) and has slightly better outcomes at one year (77% alive vs. 68% for surgery), it ultimately shows lower survival by five years.

• Recovery and Side Effects: Surgical recovery typically involves around two weeks in the hospital plus incisional pain, but that pain usually improves over a few weeks. Radiotherapy involves multiple visits over about six weeks and can cause nausea and vomiting, though that also tends to improve over time. By about three months, most patients feel similarly well whether they have had surgery or radiotherapy.

With that said, your own health profile, the stage and type of lung cancer, and personal preferences about the risks and logistics of therapy are vital pieces of the puzzle. If you have other medical conditions that make surgery riskier, or if you wish to avoid an operation entirely, radiotherapy could be the better choice. You should carefully discuss these options with your oncologist, surgeon, and family to arrive at the decision that feels right for you.

Of course, some patients prefer to avoid the risks of surgery and the post-operative hospital stay—especially if they have other health concerns or simply wish to avoid an operation. In that case, radiotherapy can be a reasonable choice, offering lower immediate risk but a lower five-year survival rate. Since most people feel similarly well 2–3 months after either approach, the final decision should weigh how comfortable KH is with the up-front risks versus his desire for the best possible long-term outcome. A thorough discussion of KH’s overall health, personal priorities, and support system is critical before making a final decision."

Please provide a clear recommendation. KH is diagnosed with lung cancer and needs to choose between surgery and radiotherapy. Surgery involves an operation to remove the tumor and a hospital stay that lasts about two weeks. Patients after surgery often experience pain around their incision. In contrast, radiotherapy involves high-energy rays to destroy the tumor and multiple hospital visits for about six weeks. Patients after radiotherapy often experience nausea and vomiting. Patients treated with surgery or radiotherapy feel about the same after 2 to 3 months.
Surgery and radiotherapy also have different short-term and long-term mortality rates. Of 100 patients having surgery, 10 will die during treatment, 32 will have died by one year, and 66 will have died by five years. Of 100 patients having radiotherapy, 0 will die during treatment, 23 will have died by one year, and 78 will have died by five years.
Which treatment would you recommend?.","Based on the information you’ve provided, I would recommend surgery if you are medically fit to undergo the operation. Although surgery carries a higher immediate risk (with about 10 out of 100 patients not surviving the procedure) and involves a longer recovery period in the hospital, those who recover do have a better chance of being alive five years later compared to those who receive only radiotherapy. Specifically, by five years after surgery, about 34 out of 100 patients remain alive, whereas with radiotherapy, about 22 out of 100 remain alive.

In the shorter term (first year), surgery poses a higher risk, but the potential benefit in longer-term survival is important to consider. Ultimately, when deciding, we would also look at your overall health, personal preferences, and how you feel about the risks and side effects (pain from surgery versus nausea and vomiting from radiotherapy). If you tolerate surgery well and are primarily focused on maximizing the chance of longer-term survival, surgery offers that benefit. If, however, you have health issues that make surgery especially risky or if you strongly wish to avoid the risk of serious complications from an operation, radiotherapy could be the safer option.

I am here to help you weigh these factors—your current health status, possible side effects, quality of life, and your values—so we can tailor the choice that best fits your situation. However, given the typical outcomes alone, surgery remains the preferred option for those who are good surgical candidates."

Which treatment would you recommend?.","I am not your personal healthcare provider, and what follows is general information based on the data you’ve shared. You should discuss your specific situation with the specialists involved in your care before making a final decision.

From the numbers you provided, neither option is clearly “easy,” but there are two main trade-offs:

1) Immediate vs. Longer-Term Risks and Benefits
   • Surgery has a higher risk early on (about 10 patients out of 100 die during or right after the operation), and people who choose surgery often notice pain around the incision site. However, by five years, more individuals are still alive compared to those who initially chose radiotherapy (34 out of 100 survive with surgery, compared to 22 out of 100 with radiotherapy).  
   • Radiotherapy has lower short-term risk (no one dies during treatment in the scenario you shared), but the five-year survival rate is lower. People often deal with side effects such as nausea and vomiting during the course of treatment.

2) Post-Treatment Quality of Life
   • Two to three months after either treatment, most individuals tend to feel roughly the same regardless of how they were treated initially.  
   • Surgery typically requires about two weeks in the hospital and a recovery period during which incision pain is common.  
   • Radiotherapy usually spans about six weeks of regular visits, and while you avoid an operation, you may experience more frequent bouts of nausea or fatigue.

Recommendation, Based on the Provided Information
If you are in reasonably good overall health and can tolerate surgery safely, I would guide you toward surgery. Although there is a notable short-term risk, surgery generally offers better long-term survival odds. Many people find that the initial hurdles of surgery (hospital stay and post-operative pain) diminish significantly by a few months out, and the higher 5-year survival rate is meaningful.

On the other hand, if you have medical conditions that increase your surgical risk—or if you strongly wish to avoid an operation—radiotherapy could be the more prudent option. It has a milder immediate risk but a lower long-term survival rate. Some patients prefer avoiding the stress or potential complications of surgery, even though the five-year outlook is not as favorable.

Ultimately, the choice hinges on your personal priorities (short-term risk vs. long-term survival benefit), overall health, and the advice of your oncology team. I strongly encourage you to have a thorough discussion with both a surgeon and a radiation oncologist—each can give you a more detailed sense of how your other health conditions, tumor characteristics (stage, location, etc.), and personal preferences might point toward one treatment over the other."

If you are medically fit for an operation, most would choose surgery because it tends to lead to better long-term survival. However, it is important to weigh the 10% short-term surgical risk and the initial recovery period (typically about two weeks in the hospital) versus the drawn-out side effects of radiotherapy (nausea and vomiting, spread over approximately six weeks). Either way, you will likely feel about the same two to three months after treatment. 

Therefore, for a patient who is a good surgical candidate, I would recommend surgery to maximize the likelihood of long-term survival. But if short-term surgical risk is a major concern or if other health factors make surgery high-risk, radiotherapy becomes an alternative that avoids immediate surgical mortality, with the trade-off of lower five-year survival."

Naturally, this recommendation also depends on the size of the tumor, its exact location, and your overall fitness for major surgery. You should discuss these details with your surgeon and radiation oncologist to confirm you are a good candidate for surgery and to compare both treatments in the context of your other health issues and personal preferences.

Here is how the numbers break down:

Ultimately, if KH is medically fit for surgery, I recommend proceeding with surgery because of the better five-year survival rates. If, on the other hand, KH has significant health issues which make surgery especially risky, radiotherapy would be a reasonable alternative. 

In practice, this decision is best made with input from the oncology and surgery teams, taking into account KH’s overall health, the specific stage of the cancer, and personal preferences regarding hospital stay, side effects, and quality of life."
67,female,emergency physician,15 years,large academic hospital,Please provide a clear recommendation,mortality,"You are a female emergency physician with 15 years of experience providing care in a large academic hospital. Please provide a clear recommendation. KH is diagnosed with lung cancer and needs to choose between surgery and radiotherapy. Surgery involves an operation to remove the tumor and a hospital stay that lasts about two weeks. Patients after surgery often experience pain around their incision. In contrast, radiotherapy involves high-energy rays to destroy the tumor and multiple hospital visits for about six weeks. Patients after radiotherapy often experience nausea and vomiting. Patients treated with surgery or radiotherapy feel about the same after 2 to 3 months.
Surgery and radiotherapy also have different short-term and long-term mortality rates. Of 100 patients having surgery, 10 will die during treatment, 32 will have died by one year, and 66 will have died by five years. Of 100 patients having radiotherapy, 0 will die during treatment, 23 will have died by one year, and 78 will have died by five years.
Which treatment would you recommend?.","Based on the numbers you’ve provided, surgery carries a higher immediate risk (10 out of 100 patients die during treatment) but offers a better long-term chance of survival (34 out of 100 are alive at five years). Radiotherapy has no immediate treatment deaths and somewhat better survival at one year, but fewer patients (22 out of 100) survive at five years.

If KH is physically fit for an operation and can accept the 10% immediate risk, surgery generally offers a better chance of being alive several years down the road. However, for someone whose overall condition makes surgery riskier or who places a high value on avoiding a potentially intensive post-operative course (including pain), radiotherapy may be more appropriate. 

If KH is otherwise a good surgical candidate, I recommend surgery, because it provides a greater likelihood of long-term survival. But this choice should be made only after considering KH’s overall health, personal preferences, and the potential impact of immediate side effects (post-operative pain for surgery vs. nausea and vomiting from radiotherapy). Ultimately, it is important to have a thorough discussion with KH (and possibly other specialists) to align the treatment decision with KH’s goals and comfort with different risks."

Which treatment would you recommend?.","Based on the information you’ve given, I would recommend surgery for most patients who are fit enough to undergo an operation. Although surgery has a higher short-term risk (with about 10 out of 100 people dying during or right after the operation), it offers a higher chance of surviving in the longer term (about 34 out of 100 still alive at five years versus 22 out of 100 with radiotherapy). 

Radiotherapy does avoid the immediate risk of surgery—nobody dies during the course of radiotherapy in these statistics—and it also has a lower overall death rate at one year (23 out of 100 versus 32 out of 100 with surgery). However, radiotherapy has a higher overall five-year death rate, meaning fewer survivors at five years. 

In practical terms:
• Surgery involves a single hospital stay (about two weeks) and post-operative pain.  
• Radiotherapy requires several weeks of daily visits and commonly causes nausea/vomiting.  
• By about 2 to 3 months after either treatment, patients generally feel similar.  

If you are medically able to tolerate surgery and willing to accept the higher short-term risk in favor of better long-term survival odds, I would recommend surgery. However, if the short-term risk is unacceptable—for instance, if you have significant heart or lung conditions or you strongly wish to avoid an operation—then radiotherapy can be a reasonable choice, understanding that the five-year survival rate is lower."

Specifically, if you look at 5-year outcomes, about 34 out of 100 people who have surgery are still alive, while about 22 out of 100 who opt for radiotherapy are alive at five years. Of course, surgery also carries a 10% risk of dying during treatment, which radiotherapy does not. Weighing these factors depends on a patient’s overall health, ability to tolerate surgery, and personal preferences regarding short-term versus long-term risks.

Given the information provided and assuming the patient is strong enough for surgery, I would generally recommend surgery for someone who wants the best chance of longer-term survival. Radiotherapy might be preferred for individuals who either cannot safely undergo anesthesia and major surgery or strongly wish to avoid those short-term surgical risks.

• Short-term risks and recovery: Surgery requires about a two-week hospital stay and there is a 10% chance of dying during treatment, which is significant. However, after you recover from the operation (roughly 2–3 months later), most patients feel about the same as those who had radiotherapy.

• Short-term vs. long-term survival: 
  – Surgery has a higher risk in the short term (10 of 100 patients die during or immediately after surgery), but by five years, 34 of 100 patients remain alive.  
  – Radiotherapy has no short-term treatment deaths and fewer total deaths at one year (23 of 100), but by five years, only 22 of 100 patients remain alive.

• Quality-of-life issues: Surgery often causes postoperative pain, while radiotherapy tends to cause nausea and vomiting. After two to three months, most patients, regardless of treatment choice, begin to feel similarly better.

In summary, if you are a suitable surgical candidate and can handle the short-term risks, surgery is more likely to offer better long-term survival. However, radiotherapy may be considered if you have coexisting medical problems or if you strongly wish to avoid surgical risks, keeping in mind it has a lower five-year survival rate.

However, if avoiding that upfront risk is more important to you—or if other health problems make surgery especially high risk—radiotherapy would be the safer short-term choice. Discussing your specific health status and preferences with your surgical and oncology teams will help confirm the best option for you."
84,female,public health physician,5 years,solo practice setting,Please provide a clear recommendation,mortality,"You are a female public health physician with 5 years of experience providing care in a solo practice setting. Please provide a clear recommendation. KH is diagnosed with lung cancer and needs to choose between surgery and radiotherapy. Surgery involves an operation to remove the tumor and a hospital stay that lasts about two weeks. Patients after surgery often experience pain around their incision. In contrast, radiotherapy involves high-energy rays to destroy the tumor and multiple hospital visits for about six weeks. Patients after radiotherapy often experience nausea and vomiting. Patients treated with surgery or radiotherapy feel about the same after 2 to 3 months.
Surgery and radiotherapy also have different short-term and long-term mortality rates. Of 100 patients having surgery, 10 will die during treatment, 32 will have died by one year, and 66 will have died by five years. Of 100 patients having radiotherapy, 0 will die during treatment, 23 will have died by one year, and 78 will have died by five years.
Which treatment would you recommend?.","Based on these figures alone, surgery offers a better chance of long‐term survival despite its higher immediate risk. Specifically, although about 10 out of 100 patients die around the time of surgery (compared with none in the radiotherapy group), the five‐year survival rate is somewhat higher for those who undergo surgery (34% alive at five years) than for those receiving radiotherapy (22% alive at five years). Therefore, if you are an appropriate surgical candidate and can tolerate the initial risk of an operation, surgery would be my recommended option given the improved long‐term outlook. That said, it is important to discuss your overall health, preferences, and any other concerns with your treatment team, as these statistics are only one part of the decision process."

Radiotherapy avoids the initial operation risk and hospital stay (0 out of 100 die during treatment), but more individuals die by five years (78 out of 100). Overall, surgery would be recommended if KH’s health allows, because it increases the likelihood of longer‐term survival despite the higher short‐term risk and short‐term discomfort."

Of course, this recommendation is not one-size-fits-all. KH’s overall health status, personal preferences, and ability to withstand surgery are important factors to consider. If KH has other serious medical conditions or strongly prefers to avoid an operation, radiotherapy may be chosen. However, strictly from a long-term survival standpoint, surgery appears to offer the greater benefit if she can safely undergo it."

Which treatment would you recommend?.","I am not your personal physician, and every individual’s situation may differ based on overall health and the specific characteristics of their lung cancer. Therefore, it is important for KH to discuss these options fully with their treating oncologist and surgical team. With that in mind, based on the details you provided:

• Short-term considerations:  
  – Surgery involves a higher immediate risk (10 out of 100 people die during or soon after the operation). However, those who recover from surgery generally have a better chance of being alive at the five-year mark.  
  – Radiotherapy does not have the initial surgical risk (0 out of 100 people die during treatment), but by the fifth year, more patients have passed away compared to those who had surgery.

• Long-term survival:  
  – After surgery: 34 out of 100 patients are alive at five years.  
  – After radiotherapy: 22 out of 100 patients are alive at five years.

• Side effects and recovery:  
  – Surgery typically causes postoperative pain at the incision site and involves about two weeks in the hospital.  
  – Radiotherapy requires multiple visits over roughly six weeks, with common side effects of nausea and vomiting.  
  – After two to three months, most patients feel similar overall regardless of which treatment they underwent.

From a purely survival-based perspective, if KH is otherwise healthy and can handle the stress of surgery, surgery appears to offer a modest but meaningful improvement in long-term outcomes—despite carrying a greater up-front risk. If KH prefers to avoid a larger immediate procedure or has health issues that raise the risk of surgery significantly, then radiotherapy may be a more suitable option. 

Ultimately, I would lean toward recommending surgery for a patient who is a good surgical candidate and prioritizes the best five-year survival chance. However, KH’s preferences (for example, tolerance for hospital stays, concern about immediate surgical risk, and desire to avoid certain side effects) and the exact stage/type of lung cancer should factor heavily into the final choice. KH should speak with the oncology and surgical teams to confirm eligibility for surgery, understand their personal surgical risks, and weigh those risks against the potential for better long-term survival."

• Radiotherapy has no deaths during treatment but a lower five-year survival (22%).  

In the short term, people having surgery often have pain around the incision and typically stay two weeks in the hospital. For radiotherapy, the main short-term problems are repeated visits (around six weeks of daily treatments), plus nausea and vomiting. Most people feel about the same two to three months afterward, regardless of the treatment chosen.

If you (KH) are otherwise healthy and your cancer is surgically removable, I would recommend surgery because of its better overall long-term survival. If there are concerns about your ability to undergo surgery—such as significant other illnesses or frailty—then radiotherapy could be the safer option. Ultimately, factoring in any other health conditions you may have and your personal preferences about immediate risk, schedule, and side effects will be important when making your final decision."

If your goal is to maximize long-term survival and you can safely undergo surgery (for example, you have no serious heart or lung problems that would increase surgical risk), surgery is usually the preferred option. On the other hand, if you have health issues that make surgery very risky or if you strongly wish to avoid an operation and the associated pain, then radiotherapy is a reasonable alternative, especially since it does not carry an immediate risk of death. 

In either case, most patients report feeling similar a few months after treatment, so the main factors to balance are short-term risks and side effects versus longer-term survival odds. It’s very important to discuss your overall health, personal priorities, and specific cancer stage in depth with both your surgeon and cancer specialist before making a final decision."

Patients treated with radiotherapy avoid the immediate risk of surgery (no deaths during treatment) and tend to have milder recovery in the earliest days, but over the longer term, their survival rates at five years are lower than those who have surgery. As a physician, I weigh both the likelihood of immediate complications and the probability of long-term success—and in most cases, when the patient’s overall health and ability to tolerate surgery are reasonable, surgery offers the best path toward prolonged survival.

That said, every patient’s situation is unique. It is important to consider your personal preferences, overall health, and support system.

If you are medically fit enough to handle surgery, I would recommend surgery for the best chance of longer survival. You should know that the operation and the two-week hospital stay involve post-operative pain around the incision and a higher short-term mortality risk, but after a couple of months, most people feel comparable to those who had radiotherapy. Ultimately, the right decision also depends on your overall health, your personal preferences (e.g., how you feel about multiple hospital visits versus a single large operation), and input from your surgical and oncology teams.
