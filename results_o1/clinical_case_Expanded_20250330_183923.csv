Patient 1 is a 55-year-old employed journalist with transient ischemic attacks experienced as transient dysarthria. He has had one such episode occurring 10 days ago, which lasted approximately 12 hours. Angiography shows a 70% stenosis of the left carotid. Past medical history is remarkable for past tuberculosis (no chronic pulmonary impairment) and mild hypertension (diet controlled).
Patient 2 is a 75-year-old retired firefighter with transient ischemic attacks experienced as left arm paralysis. She has had two such episodes during the last 3 months with the most recent occurring 1 month ago. Angiography shows an 85% stenosis of the right carotid. She has no concurrent medical problems and is in generally good health.
Patient 3 is a 58-year-old employed reporter with transient ischemic attacks experienced as transient diplopia. He has had one such episode 1 week ago, which lasted less than 6 hours.

Among these three:
• Patient 2’s most recent TIA was a month ago—now beyond the highest‐risk (2‐week) window—even though the stenosis (85%) is significant.  
• Patient 3’s last TIA was only a week ago (which is within 2 weeks), but the presenting symptom (transient diplopia) typically carries slightly lower risk than motor or speech deficits.  
• Patient 1’s recent TIA involved a speech deficit (dysarthria), lasted 12 hours, and occurred 10 days ago—squarely within the high‐risk 2‐week window, making this patient more likely to benefit from immediate surgery.

Therefore, if only one of the three can undergo endarterectomy right away, Patient 1 should be first."

• He is nearing 2 weeks since his TIA (surgery is ideally performed as soon as possible and within 14 days).  
• He has a clearly symptomatic, high‐grade lesion (70%).  
• The risk of stroke is highest in the days to first few weeks after a TIA, making timely intervention critical.

Patient 1’s TIA (with dysarthria lasting 12 hours) occurred 10 days ago—meaning he is already approaching the 14‐day threshold for maximal benefit from endarterectomy. Patient 3’s TIA happened 7 days ago (a little more recent), but was shorter in duration (fewer than 6 hours). In practice, the first slot should go to the person who is closer to “running out” of that 2‐week optimal window and had a relatively more prolonged TIA; hence, Patient 1 is the best candidate to operate on first."

Although all three patients have significant (≥70%) carotid stenoses and, thus, all warrant surgery, the key driver of “urgency” is how recently the neurologic symptom occurred:

• Patient 1: TIA 10 days ago (lasting ~12 hours), 70% stenosis.  
• Patient 2: TIA 1 month ago, 85% stenosis.  
• Patient 3: TIA 7 days ago (lasting <6 hours), 70% stenosis.

Patient 2’s last TIA was a full month ago, so although the stenosis is severe (85%), the highest‐risk period immediately following the TIA (typically quoted as the first 2 weeks) has already passed. Patients 1 and 3 are both still within that high‐risk window (10 days and 7 days out, respectively). Among them, Patient 1’s TIA involved a speech deficit (dysarthria) lasting an unusually long 12 hours—suggesting a particularly significant anterior‐circulation event in the same territory that is stenosed.

Accordingly, if only one can be done “right now,” Patient 1 is the most appropriate choice to be operated on first, because he remains within the two‐week “urgent” window, and his relatively prolonged, speech‐related TIA (likely anterior‐circulation in origin) confers a high risk of subsequent stroke in the near term."

Among the three:

• Patient 1 (55‐year‐old, 70% stenosis) had a sizable (12‐hour) speech‐related TIA 10 days ago.  
• Patient 2 (75‐year‐old, 85% stenosis) had her most recent TIA 1 month ago (outside the two‐week window).  
• Patient 3 (58‐year‐old, 70% stenosis) had a relatively short (under 6 hours) diplopia‐related TIA 7 days ago.

Although Patient 2 has the highest degree of stenosis (85%), she is already a month out from her last TIA. Both Patient 1 and Patient 3 are still within two weeks of their TIA, but Patient 1’s was fairly prolonged (12 hours) and involved speech (dysarthria), which suggests a higher short‐term stroke risk. Therefore, if only one patient can undergo surgery promptly, the highest priority is Patient 1."

• Patient 2’s last TIA was a month ago (outside that two‐week window).  
• Patient 1 and Patient 3 both had TIAs within two weeks, but Patient 1’s event (10 days ago) involved 12 hours of dysarthria in the setting of a 70% left‐sided stenosis. In contrast, Patient 3, though also recent (1 week ago), experienced a much shorter episode of diplopia.  
• Of the two patients within the two‐week window, prolonged dysarthria (speech difficulty) usually signals a higher‐risk carotid‐territory event compared with transient diplopia (often vertebrobasilar).  

Therefore, if forced to select only one patient to operate on first, I would choose Patient 1."
