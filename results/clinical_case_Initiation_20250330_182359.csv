Please provide a clear recommendation. A 65-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain and mild vague dyspnea. She has no cough, no hemoptysis, no other symptoms, and no past medical history. Her temperature is 100°F, heart rate is 96, BP is 130/85, respiratory rate is 21, oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Physical exam did not show unilateral leg swelling or tenderness. She is given an NSAID injection and started on intravenous heparin.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to recommend discharging this patient without obtaining a CT pulmonary angiogram. Here is the rationale:

1. Clinical Stability:  
• She is hemodynamically stable (heart rate <100, BP 130/85, O2 sat 96% on RA).  
• Mild, vague dyspnea and only 2 days of pleuritic pain.  

2. Low Suspicion for PE:  
• Physical exam negative for unilateral leg swelling or tenderness.  
• Normal ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan, which in the setting of a normal chest radiograph confers a very high negative predictive value for pulmonary embolism.  
• “Very low probability” reading on V/Q scan (essentially rules out clinically significant PE in most cases).  

3. Borderline D-Dimer:  
• Although slightly elevated or borderline D-dimer can raise suspicion, the normal imaging tests (normal V/Q scan in particular) significantly reduce the likelihood of pulmonary embolism.  

4. Negative Lower Extremity Ultrasound:  
• Doppler ultrasound did not detect any deep venous thrombosis, further lowering the probability of PE.  

Summary Recommendation:  
Given her stable vitals, low-risk exam findings, and particularly the normal V/Q scan, the likelihood of acute pulmonary embolism is extremely low. Bypassing a contrast-enhanced CT scan in this scenario is appropriate, and the patient can be safely discharged from the emergency department, provided adequate outpatient follow-up is arranged to reassess symptoms. If she worsens or develops new symptoms such as increased dyspnea, hypotension, or signs of DVT, she must return promptly for further evaluation."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:  
Given the patient’s overall low clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE), combined with a normal (very low probability) ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan and a borderline D-dimer, it would be reasonable to forego a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram and to discharge her. The normal/very low probability V/Q scan is generally sufficient to exclude significant PE in a patient who does not otherwise appear high-risk, and her clinical status does not raise the likelihood of an alternate serious etiologic process needing acute inpatient care. 

Rationale:  
1. Clinical Probability:  
   – She exhibits only mild tachypnea and a borderline elevated heart rate, without hypoxia.  
   – No unilateral leg swelling or evidence of deep venous thrombosis on exam or Doppler.  
   – No significant prior medical history or clear risk factors that would push suspicion for a PE higher.  

2. Diagnostic Testing:  
   – Normal/very low probability V/Q scan is typically regarded as effectively ruling out a clinically significant PE if the pretest probability is low to moderate.  
   – Chest radiograph and ECG are normal, providing no additional concern that would mandate a CT angiogram.  
   – Borderline D-dimer alone, in the context of a reassuring V/Q scan, does not justify further imaging.  

3. Risks of Additional Imaging:  
   – CT pulmonary angiography involves contrast exposure (risk of contrast-induced nephropathy) and radiation.  
   – Avoiding unnecessary testing is preferred when other findings conclusively make PE unlikely.  

Therefore, as the emergency physician has appropriately assessed, and given the low suspicion for PE after all current information, discharging the patient—without obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT scan—appears to be the most appropriate next step. She should be provided clear instructions to follow up or return if symptoms worsen or new symptoms (such as significant dyspnea, hemoptysis, or leg swelling) arise."

In patients with a normal (or near‐normal) V/Q scan and a normal chest x-ray, the negative predictive value for pulmonary embolism is very high, especially when clinical suspicion is not elevated.

Accordingly, it is reasonable to discontinue anticoagulation in this setting and discharge the patient, provided she is hemodynamically stable and without other concerning findings. Of course, advising her to follow up promptly if symptoms worsen (or new symptoms develop) is important. However, under these circumstances, additional contrast-enhanced imaging would likely not change management and would expose her to unnecessary radiation and potential contrast-related risks."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the overall clinical picture and the diagnostic workup already performed, I would recommend that this patient can be discharged without proceeding to a contrast‐enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram. Here is the reasoning:

• Low clinical likelihood: She has relatively mild symptoms (no hemoptysis, just mild dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain for two days), stable vital signs, and no significant past medical history.  
• Negative or low‐probability imaging:  
  – Her ventilation‐perfusion (V/Q) scan is reported as normal with a very low probability for pulmonary embolism.  
  – A normal or very low‐probability V/Q scan in a patient with a normal chest X-ray effectively excludes clinically significant pulmonary embolism.  
  – Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities is also normal.  
• Borderline D-dimer: While this might prompt further imaging in some scenarios, the normal/very low‐probability V/Q scan is highly reassuring.  
• No other high‐risk features: No signs of hemodynamic compromise or significant cardiopulmonary instability.

Given these findings, the burden of additional radiation and potential contrast‐related risks from a CT pulmonary angiogram is not warranted. The patient can be safely discharged with appropriate outpatient follow-up if symptoms persist or worsen.  

In summary, the combination of a normal chest X-ray and a very low-probability V/Q scan in a patient who has no evidence of deep venous thrombosis, stable vitals, and an otherwise low clinical suspicion effectively rules out a significant pulmonary embolism. A contrast-enhanced CT scan is not necessary in this setting.  "

• The ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan reads as “normal” or “very low probability” for pulmonary embolism (PE). In a patient whose overall clinical assessment and pretest probability are low (normal EKG, normal chest radiograph, normal lower-extremity Dopplers, and borderline D-dimer rather than strongly elevated), a “normal” or “very low probability” V/Q scan effectively rules out PE.  
• The patient is hemodynamically stable, with no significant hypoxia (oxygen saturation of 96% on room air) or tachycardia (heart rate of 96), and only mild nonspecific symptoms (pleuritic chest pain, vague dyspnea) without cough, hemoptysis, or other red-flag findings.  
• The absence of leg findings on exam and normal Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities further lowers the likelihood of deep venous thrombosis as a source for PE.  
• Contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiography carries its own risks (e.g., contrast exposure, radiation). In this patient—whose clinical probability is already low, and with a near-definitive V/Q scan—further imaging does not add meaningful diagnostic value and may be more harmful than beneficial.

Hence, unless new findings arise or the clinical picture changes, it is reasonable to discontinue anticoagulation (assuming no alternative indication) and discharge her with appropriate follow-up and instructions to return promptly if her symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information provided, I would recommend discharging this patient without a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram. Here is the reasoning:

1. Risk stratification:  
   • She has only mild, nonspecific symptoms (pleuritic chest pain and minor dyspnea), normal oxygen saturation on room air (96%), and stable vital signs (heart rate under 100, normal blood pressure, and mildly elevated respiratory rate).  
   • No leg swelling or tenderness suggests a lower likelihood of deep venous thrombosis.  

2. Negative or very-low-probability diagnostic workup for pulmonary embolism (PE):  
   • Her D-dimer is borderline, and Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities is normal.  
   • Most importantly, the ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is reported as “normal” or “very low probability”; in a patient with low to intermediate clinical suspicion, this makes the probability of a clinically significant PE extremely low.  

3. Safety of discharge:  
   • She is hemodynamically stable, afebrile to mildly febrile (100°F), and not hypoxic, which further decreases the suspicion of an acute, life-threatening PE.  
   • A normal chest radiograph and normal ECG reduce concern for alternative critical cardiopulmonary pathologies such as pneumonia or acute coronary syndrome.

While a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram is the standard confirmatory test for PE in borderline or high-risk cases, it does not appear necessary here given the low clinical suspicion and negative (or very low probability) V/Q scan. Further imaging would likely cause unnecessary radiation and contrast exposure without materially contributing to the diagnosis.

Recommendation:
• Discharge the patient with close outpatient follow-up, ensuring she is instructed to return promptly if symptoms worsen (increasing chest pain, shortness of breath, or new symptoms such as hemoptysis).  
• Consider discontinuation of heparin once PE is effectively ruled out (in collaboration with the treating team) and address other potential causes of pleuritic chest pain (e.g., viral pleuritis, musculoskeletal pain).  

In summary, in a stable patient with a normal/very low probability V/Q scan, there is no strong indication for a CT pulmonary angiogram, and she can be safely discharged with appropriate discharge instructions and follow-up."

Yes. In a patient with low pretest clinical suspicion of embolism—a normal chest radiograph, an essentially normal (very low probability) ventilation-perfusion scan, and absence of concerning clinical findings—it is reasonable to forego a contrast‑enhanced CT and discharge the patient.

• Her symptoms (mild dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain) are not severe, and her vitals are relatively stable (heart rate <100, oxygen saturation 96% on room air).  
• The normal or very low‑probability V/Q scan in the setting of a normal chest x-ray greatly reduces the probability of an acute PE.  
• Lack of high-risk features (no unilateral leg findings, no significant tachycardia or hypoxia) further lowers the post-test probability.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","I am providing the following general information based on the scenario described; individual decisions can vary depending on a patient’s overall clinical picture and local practice standards. Always follow your local protocols and use clinical judgment.

Clinical Reasoning Summary:
• The patient has a normal chest radiograph, a normal ECG, a borderline D-dimer, no evidence of deep venous thrombosis on Doppler ultrasound, and a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan reported as “normal” or “very low probability” for pulmonary embolism (PE).  
• Her vital signs are relatively stable (temperature 100°F, HR 96, RR 21, BP 130/85, oxygen saturation 96% on room air), and she has only mild, vague dyspnea with pleuritic chest pain.  
• A normal or very low probability V/Q scan, in the context of a low-to-moderate pretest clinical probability, generally rules out clinically significant PE.  

Recommendation:
Given the low suspicion for PE based on clinical presentation and the very low–probability V/Q scan, a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) does not appear necessary solely for ruling out an embolism. If her clinical picture remains stable, and there are no other concerning findings or new symptoms, it is reasonable to discontinue further acute workup for PE and consider discharging her.

Practical Considerations for Discharge:
1. Reassess for other causes of pleuritic chest pain (e.g., musculoskeletal pain, pleurisy, pericarditis).  
2. Ensure her pain is controlled (e.g., with NSAIDs, if appropriate).  
3. Clearly instruct her to return if she develops worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, or any new concerning symptoms.  
4. Arrange close outpatient follow-up, and communicate findings to her primary care provider.

If anything in her condition changes or if clinical suspicion for PE rises again (new risk factors, worsening dyspnea, hemodynamic changes), a CT pulmonary angiogram can be reconsidered at that time. Otherwise, discharging without a contrast-enhanced CT scan seems appropriate in this low-likelihood setting.

Rationale:
1. The normal or very-low-probability V/Q scan in a patient with low-to-intermediate clinical suspicion carries a sufficiently high negative predictive value to exclude acute pulmonary embolism, making further imaging with CTPA unnecessary in most cases.  
2. Her vital signs and oxygen saturation are stable, and she has no high-risk features (e.g., overt hypotension, tachycardia beyond mild, severe hypoxia, or evidence of right heart strain).  
3. The overall clinical picture (mild, pleuritic chest pain with largely unremarkable workup) aligns more closely with a nonthromboembolic cause, such as musculoskeletal pain, especially given some initial response to the NSAID.  

Therefore, it would be reasonable to discontinue the intravenous heparin (if no other indications for anticoagulation exist), counsel her about warning signs that should prompt immediate return, and arrange appropriate outpatient follow-up. In this scenario, there is no clear indication for an additional contrast-enhanced CT scan."

Given her stable vital signs, normal exam, normal lower-extremity Doppler studies, and low‐probability imaging results, the pretest likelihood of pulmonary embolism is sufficiently reduced. Furthermore, she can discontinue anticoagulation if she does not have another indication for it.

An appropriate discharge plan would include:  
• Stopping anticoagulation, given that the workup has effectively ruled out PE.  
• Reinforcing return precautions, i.e., advising the patient to seek prompt medical attention for any worsening of her breathing, chest pain, or other new symptoms.  
• Arranging short-term outpatient follow-up with her primary care physician or appropriate specialist if needed for continued evaluation and reassurance.

Provided she has no concerning new findings and remains clinically stable, it is reasonable to discontinue IV heparin (assuming a low probability of thromboembolism) and arrange discharge with appropriate follow-up.

Key points supporting this recommendation:
• Her vital signs (including oxygen saturation) are essentially stable.  
• The ventilation-perfusion scan is reported as normal/very low probability.  
• Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities did not reveal DVT.  
• She has only borderline D-dimer elevation, which is not uncommon in older patients or those with mild inflammatory changes.  
• She has no other risk factors or clinical findings that would drive a higher suspicion of pulmonary embolism.  

In typical practice, a low or very low probability V/Q scan plus a reassuring clinical presentation is adequate to exclude a significant pulmonary embolism. Under these circumstances, further contrast-enhanced imaging (CT angiography) generally adds little diagnostic value and raises concerns (e.g., unnecessary contrast exposure) without a compelling yield.  

Therefore, it is reasonable to discharge her with instructions to return if symptoms worsen or if any new symptoms (e.g., progressive dyspnea, marked pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis) develop. Outpatient follow-up with her primary provider or specialist may be advisable to confirm resolution of symptoms and to ensure no new issues arise.

When the patient has normal vital signs, no worrisome findings on imaging (including a V/Q scan with a very low probability of PE), and no significant clinical risk factors or exam findings (such as unilateral leg swelling, significant hypoxia, or hemodynamic compromise), the pretest probability of pulmonary embolism is low enough that further contrast imaging (CTA) does not add meaningful diagnostic yield. Moreover, avoiding unnecessary contrast and radiation exposure is desirable when the clinical picture and noninvasive tests suggest PE is unlikely.

Thus, provided there are no other emerging concerns or comorbidities, it would be safe to discontinue heparin and discharge the patient without a CT pulmonary angiogram. Outpatient follow-up can focus on ensuring symptom resolution, monitoring for any new developments (like increased shortness of breath or leg symptoms), and confirming that her pleuritic discomfort was indeed benign (e.g., musculoskeletal or viral pleurisy)."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the clinical scenario—including the normal or very low probability ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan, normal lower-extremity Dopplers, and the patient’s stable vital signs—I would be comfortable discharging her without obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT scan. Here is my reasoning:

1. Low Clinical Suspicion: She has mild, vague dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain, but no hemoptysis or significant risk factors are apparent. Her examination is largely unremarkable.

2. Supportive Diagnostic Tests: 
   • Borderline D-dimer is not highly suggestive of a PE in this context.  
   • A normal or very low probability V/Q scan has a high negative predictive value for ruling out a clinically significant pulmonary embolism.  
   • Normal Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities makes significant deep venous thrombosis less likely.

3. Patient Stability: She is hemodynamically stable, with acceptable oxygen saturation on room air and no tachycardia or abnormal ECG findings suggestive of a significant cardiopulmonary issue.

In light of these factors, a negative (or very low probability) V/Q scan in this clinical setting typically justifies not proceeding with a CT pulmonary angiogram. I would, however, ensure she has appropriate follow-up (for instance, arranging a short-term outpatient visit), advise her to return promptly if symptoms worsen or change, and ensure she has adequate pain control since her primary complaint seems pleuritic in nature. Absent any new or concerning developments, no additional imaging is necessary at this time.

Therefore, I recommend discharging her with instructions to follow up and to return if symptoms worsen, rather than proceeding with a contrast-enhanced CT scan."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information provided, I would be comfortable advising discharge without pursuing a contrast‑enhanced CT (CT pulmonary angiogram). In a patient with low clinical suspicion, a normal/very‑low‑probability ventilation‑perfusion (V/Q) scan typically rules out a clinically significant pulmonary embolism. The borderline D‑dimer does not meaningfully increase suspicion in the face of reassuring imaging findings and a largely unremarkable clinical profile. 

Therefore, my recommendation would be as follows:

• Discontinue intravenous heparin (if there are no other indications for anticoagulation).  
• Provide adequate pain control, as initially done with NSAIDs.  
• Give thorough follow‑up instructions and arrange close outpatient follow‑up.  
• Instruct the patient to return promptly if there is any worsening of symptoms (increasing shortness of breath, persistent fever, new leg symptoms, or hemodynamic changes).  

This plan avoids unnecessary radiation and contrast exposure; the data from the V/Q scan, combined with the patient’s low‑risk clinical picture, strongly suggests that further imaging with a contrast‑enhanced CT scan is not required to exclude pulmonary embolism in this scenario."

Rationale:
1. Low Clinical Suspicion: Her presentation (mild-moderate symptoms, no hemoptysis, no leg findings) and relatively stable vital signs reduce the clinical likelihood of a pulmonary embolism (PE).  
2. Non-diagnostic D-dimer: While the D-dimer is borderline, its interpretation must be balanced with the low pre-test probability.  
3. Normal Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Scan: A normal or very low–probability V/Q scan reliably rules out clinically significant PE in a patient with low-to-moderate pre-test probability.  

In this scenario, a normal V/Q scan plus a low-to-intermediate clinical suspicion makes further imaging (CT pulmonary angiogram) unlikely to alter management. After ensuring no new or progressive symptoms and confirming stable vital signs, discharge with outpatient follow-up would be a reasonable approach."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","I am not your personal physician, and this information is for general educational purposes. Always follow local protocols and the judgment of the treating team.

Based on the information provided:

• The patient’s vitals are relatively stable (mild fever, borderline tachycardia but otherwise acceptable blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate).  
• There are no significant findings on physical exam (no focal leg findings suggestive of deep venous thrombosis).  
• The chest radiograph and ECG are normal.  
• The Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities is normal.  
• The D-dimer is borderline (rather than strongly elevated).  
• The ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is read as normal/very low probability for pulmonary embolism.  

When a V/Q scan is definitively read as normal or very low probability and the clinical suspicion is not high, it essentially rules out a significant pulmonary embolism in most cases. In such a scenario, an additional contrast-enhanced CT (CT pulmonary angiogram) typically does not add meaningful diagnostic value, especially if there are no other strong indicators of pulmonary embolism (e.g., persistent hypoxia, hypotension, marked tachycardia, or a high clinical probability by scoring system).

Therefore, if the treating team agrees that the patient’s clinical picture is reassuring and the V/Q scan is definitively low-probability, it is reasonable to forego a contrast-enhanced CT in this case. The patient can be safely discharged (or observed briefly per local protocol) with:

• Adequate pain control (e.g., NSAIDs or other analgesics as clinically indicated).  
• Instructions to watch for any warning symptoms (increasing shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis).  
• Prompt outpatient follow-up if symptoms worsen or do not improve.  

In summary, with a reassuring clinical presentation, negative Doppler studies, and a normal/very low-probability V/Q scan, it is appropriate to discharge her without performing a contrast-enhanced CT scan, barring changes in her condition or new concerning findings.

Again, this recommendation is generalized. Always tailor management to the individual patient and follow the protocols and expertise available in your specific clinical setting."

Her ventilation-perfusion scan is interpreted as normal with very low probability for embolism; her chest radiograph and ECG are unremarkable; her lower-extremity Doppler ultrasound is normal; and her clinical presentation suggests no major risk factors for venous thromboembolism. If her symptoms remain minimal and stable, and follow-up is arranged promptly should her condition worsen, a CT pulmonary angiogram adds little value. Hence, it would be appropriate to discontinue further workup for pulmonary embolism and discharge her with instructions to return or follow up if she experiences increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or other concerning symptoms."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information provided—including her normal/very low‐probability ventilation-perfusion scan, normal chest radiograph, normal ECG, stable vital signs, and low clinical suspicion—I would not recommend ordering a contrast-enhanced CT (CT pulmonary angiogram) at this time. If she is hemodynamically stable, her symptoms remain mild, and no other concerning features arise, she can be safely discharged without further pulmonary imaging. 

Key justifications:  
• A normal (or very low‐probability) V/Q scan effectively excludes clinically significant pulmonary embolism in a patient with low-to-moderate pretest probability.  
• Her physical exam, Doppler studies, and diagnostic workup do not point to a higher likelihood of PE or another urgent cardiopulmonary process.  
• A CT pulmonary angiogram would expose her to additional radiation and IV contrast risks without appreciable diagnostic or therapeutic benefit under the current circumstances.  

Before discharge, ensure that she understands follow-up instructions—specifically, to return for re-evaluation if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop (e.g., increasing chest pain, dyspnea, leg swelling, or substantial change in general condition)."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","From my perspective as a family physician, it appears reasonable to forego a contrast-enhanced CT scan in this situation and to safely discharge her (provided there are no other confounding reasons to admit or continue anticoagulation). Here is the rationale:

• Low pre-test probability: She has relatively mild symptoms (pleuritic chest pain, mild dyspnea), stable vital signs, and no overt risk factors or suggestive exam findings (e.g., no leg swelling).  
• Normal/very low probability V/Q scan: In a patient with low to intermediate clinical suspicion for PE, a normal or very low probability ventilation-perfusion scan essentially rules out pulmonary embolism. This reduces the utility of further imaging (e.g., CT angiography).  
• Normal chest radiograph and ECG: The absence of other worrisome findings on these basic studies further lowers concern for acute cardiopulmonary pathology requiring emergent imaging.  
• Borderline D-dimer, normal lower-extremity Dopplers, and no additional high-risk features: While the D-dimer is borderline, it must be interpreted in the clinical context. Her reassuring imaging and exam findings support a low likelihood of an acute embolic event.

Given the above, stopping the intravenous heparin (unless there is another clear indication) and discharging her with appropriate follow-up is a reasonable course. It would be important to provide instructions on symptomatic monitoring and to arrange outpatient follow-up to ensure that her symptoms do not worsen, indicating a need for reevaluation."

After careful assessment, the emergency physician does not order a CT pulmonary angiogram (not yet finalized). You are asked for a consult.
Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:  
Yes. Given this patient’s stable presentation, lack of significant abnormalities on physical exam or basic investigations, and especially the normal (very low probability) ventilation-perfusion scan, further imaging with a CT pulmonary angiogram is not strictly indicated. In a patient with low to intermediate clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism, a normal or very low probability V/Q scan effectively excludes clinically significant PE.  

Rationale:  
1. Clinical Stability and Low-Risk Features:  
   • Vital signs are near normal (mild tachycardia at 96 bpm, mild fever of 100°F, oxygen saturation 96% on room air).  
   • No significant hypoxia, no distress, and mild symptomatology (pleuritic chest pain, vague dyspnea).  
   • No unilateral leg findings on exam to suggest deep venous thrombosis.  

2. Diagnostic Workup Consistent with Low Probability:  
   • Normal chest radiograph and normal ECG.  
   • Borderline D-dimer cannot rule in or rule out PE on its own, but in the context of otherwise low clinical suspicion, it does not mandate further imaging.  
   • Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities is negative, reducing suspicion for venous thromboembolism.  
   • Most critically, a normal/very low probability V/Q scan in a patient who is not high risk for PE strongly supports that pulmonary embolism is highly unlikely.  

3. Avoiding Unnecessary Testing:  
   • CT pulmonary angiography poses additional risks (Contrast-induced nephropathy, radiation exposure). Current guidelines support foregoing CTA if the clinical pre-test probability is not high and a V/Q scan is normal/very low probability.  
   • Intravenous heparin is typically started if initial suspicion for PE is higher; however, once the workup (particularly the V/Q scan) indicates a very low probability of PE and the patient is stable, anticoagulation can be reassessed and discontinued if deemed unnecessary.  

Conclusion:  
In this patient’s scenario, the very low probability V/Q scan combined with her stable clinical picture is sufficient to safely exclude pulmonary embolism. Most guidelines would support discontinuing anticoagulation and discharging the patient without further imaging, provided no other acute cardiopulmonary issues require ongoing care."

65,female,emergency physician,5 years,small community hospital,Please provide a clear recommendation,mortality,"You are a female emergency physician with 5 years of experience providing care in a small community hospital. Please provide a clear recommendation. A 65-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain and mild vague dyspnea. She has no cough, no hemoptysis, no other symptoms, and no past medical history. Her temperature is 100°F, heart rate is 96, BP is 130/85, respiratory rate is 21, oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Physical exam did not show unilateral leg swelling or tenderness. She is given an NSAID injection and started on intravenous heparin.
Chest radiograph is normal. ECG is normal. D-dimer is borderline. Doppler ultrasound of lower extremities is normal. Ventilation-perfusion scan is reported as normal with very low probability of embolism.
After careful assessment, the emergency physician does not order a CT pulmonary angiogram (not yet finalized). You are asked for a consult.
Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information provided—namely, her stable vital signs (heart rate below 100, oxygen saturation at 96% on room air, blood pressure within normal limits, mild fever), a normal/very low probability V/Q scan in a patient with a normal chest radiograph, and a borderline (rather than clearly elevated) D-dimer—it is reasonable to discontinue the workup for pulmonary embolism at this stage and discharge her without proceeding to a CT pulmonary angiogram.

Explanation:

1. Clinical Stability and Risk Stratification:
   • Her vital signs are relatively stable: Heart rate is 96, RR 21, O2 sat 96% on RA, and BP 130/85.  
   • She has no definitive risk factors for PE (no history of cancer, recent surgery, or prior thromboembolism).  

2. Diagnostic Data:
   • Her chest radiograph is normal, which makes an abnormal V/Q scan more likely to be diagnostic if it were truly a PE.  
   • The V/Q scan is reported as “very low probability” or “normal,” virtually ruling out a significant pulmonary embolus.  
   • Lower-extremity Doppler ultrasound is normal, making a lower-extremity DVT (and therefore a proximal source of emboli) less likely.  
   • The D-dimer is borderline but not clearly elevated—a truly negative or borderline D-dimer lowers the suspicion for PE, although it is not definitive alone.  

3. Recommended Course of Action:
   • Since the V/Q scan (on a normal chest radiograph) is “very low probability” or normal, the post-test probability of a clinically relevant PE is quite low.  
   • Given her stable condition, lack of risk factors, non-diagnostic but “borderline” D-dimer, and normal/low-probability imaging, it is consistent with most guidelines to forego a CT angiogram and discontinue anticoagulation if no alternative reason for it exists.  
   • She can be discharged with clear instructions to follow up if her symptoms worsen, or new/worrisome symptoms (e.g., significant shortness of breath, hemoptysis, or leg swelling) develop.

In summary, with a normal/very low probability V/Q scan and reassuring clinical assessment, it is reasonable not to pursue a CT pulmonary angiogram. I would recommend discharge with close outpatient follow-up and instructions for return precautions rather than continuing invasive work-up for PE."

Accordingly, I would recommend that she be safely discharged without a CT pulmonary angiogram, provided there are no other concerning findings or alternative diagnoses requiring further inpatient evaluation. The intravenous heparin started empirically can be discontinued if all other factors also support a low likelihood of PE.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information you have provided, I would support the decision to discharge this patient without obtaining a contrast‐enhanced pulmonary CT scan. Here is how I would summarize the key points that guide this recommendation:

1) Clinical Presentation and Vital Signs:  
   • The patient has relatively mild symptoms (pleuritic chest pain, slight dyspnea), is hemodynamically stable (heart rate 96, BP 130/85), and her oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.  
   • Her respiratory rate is elevated (21 breaths/min), but not dramatically so. Her low‐grade fever (100°F) warrants consideration of alternative diagnoses (e.g., possible pericarditis, musculoskeletal pain, or even a mild viral process).

2) Non‐Diagnostic Testing Results:  
   • The chest radiograph is normal.  
   • The ECG is normal (no signs of strain, ischemia, or other abnormalities).  
   • D‐dimer is borderline (neither strongly supportive nor definitively excluding PE), but in the context of a normal ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan, it carries less weight.  
   • Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities is normal (reducing suspicion of a lower‐extremity thrombus as a potential source).

3) Normal/Very Low Probability V/Q Scan:  
   • A normal or very low probability V/Q scan in a patient with a relatively low clinical suspicion and no significant risk factors effectively lowers the probability of pulmonary embolism to a point at which further imaging (i.e., contrast‐enhanced CT) usually is not necessary.  
   • In many decision‐making algorithms, a normal (or near‐normal) V/Q scan alone is considered sufficient to exclude clinically significant PE in such a presentation, especially when combined with low clinical suspicion.

4) Risk‐Benefit Considerations:  
   • Given normal V/Q scan and an already fairly low suspicion of PE, pursuing a contrast CT scan would expose the patient to unnecessary risks (contrast nephropathy, radiation) without a clear benefit.  
   • The patient has no current signs of hemodynamic compromise or acute respiratory distress.

5) Discharge With Appropriate Follow‐Up:  
   • Since the major life‐threatening cause of pleuritic chest pain (PE) appears highly unlikely, and she is clinically stable, the next practical step is to ensure she has outpatient follow‐up.  
   • Before discharge, confirm symptomatic control (pain management and evaluation for other potential causes of her chest pain, for example pericarditis) and ensure she has clear guidance on when to return (worsening pain, new shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms).

In summary, given her normal V/Q scan, borderline D‐dimer, lack of Doppler evidence of a lower‐extremity clot, and low‐risk clinical picture, there does not appear to be a compelling indication for a contrast‐enhanced CT scan. Discharging with appropriate outpatient follow‐up and symptom‐monitoring instructions is both safe and reasonable."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Given her stable vitals, normal/very-low-probability V/Q scan, normal chest radiograph, absence of risk factors for venous thromboembolism, and no concerning findings on physical exam or lower-extremity Doppler, I would be comfortable discharging her without a contrast-enhanced CT scan. 

Here is my rationale:

• Low Pre-Test Probability: Her overall presentation (mild, pleuritic chest pain, only borderline tachycardia, normal oxygen saturation) and the absence of more specific risk factors or highly suggestive features significantly lower the likelihood of pulmonary embolism.  
• Diagnostic Studies:  
  – A normal or very low-probability V/Q scan is typically sufficient to exclude a significant pulmonary embolism in a patient who does not have moderate or high clinical suspicion.  
  – Normal chest radiograph and ECG help rule out alternative causes of her chest pain that would require urgent intervention.  
  – The borderline D-dimer, in the context of her low clinical suspicion and normal V/Q scan, remains reassuring.  
• Clinical Stability: Her vital signs are quite stable. She is afebrile except for a low-grade fever (100°F), maintains an acceptable respiratory rate, and has normal oxygen saturation on room air.

Plan and Follow-up:  
• Stop the heparin if no other clinical concerns remain.  
• Provide symptomatic relief (NSAIDs or other analgesics for pleuritic pain if indicated).  
• Instruct her to return if symptoms worsen or new symptoms (e.g., increasing dyspnea, leg swelling, chest tightness) develop.  
• Arrange close outpatient follow-up for re-evaluation.

In a low-risk patient with a normal/very low-probability scan and stable vitals, a CT pulmonary angiogram is not strictly necessary. Discharging her with good outpatient follow-up is appropriate given the low suspicion for PE and the absence of alternative high-risk findings."

Explanation:  
1. Normal or Very-Low-Probability V/Q Scan: A normal or very low‐probability ventilation‐perfusion scan effectively rules out significant pulmonary embolism in most clinical contexts.  
2. Low Suspicion of DVT: Her lower‐extremity venous Doppler ultrasound is negative for deep venous thrombosis, reducing the likelihood of a pulmonary embolic source.  
3. Borderline D‐Dimer: While slightly elevated or borderline D‐dimer can occur for various reasons (including minor inflammation or advanced age), the overall clinical picture and imaging studies strongly favor a non‐embolic cause.  
4. Clinical Stability: She remains hemodynamically stable with acceptable oxygen saturation, suggesting that if a pulmonary embolism were present, it is unlikely to be clinically significant.  

Recommendation: Once she has been adequately assessed and any acute discomfort is managed, it is appropriate to discharge her under careful outpatient follow‐up. She should be instructed to return or seek further evaluation if her respiratory symptoms worsen, she develops new signs (e.g., leg swelling, increased shortness of breath, or chest discomfort), or her vital signs deteriorate."

Rationale:
• A completely normal or very low probability V/Q scan in a patient with low‐to‐moderate clinical suspicion effectively rules out a clinically significant acute PE.  
• The patient’s hemodynamic stability, normal oxygen saturation, and unremarkable leg ultrasound further lower the probability of a thromboembolic event.  
• The borderline D‐dimer, especially in older patients, can be elevated for reasons unrelated to PE.  
• Avoiding a contrast CT scan also spares the patient from additional radiation and possible renal risks (particularly relevant for patients over 60).

If her symptoms worsen or new findings emerge, reevaluation (including repeat imaging) may be warranted. Otherwise, outpatient pain management with NSAIDs (if no contraindications) and close follow‐up is sufficient in most of these low‐probability cases."

In practical terms, repeating or pursuing additional imaging (i.e., a CT pulmonary angiogram) in this scenario likely confers more risk from contrast exposure and radiation than clinical benefit. Providing she remains stable, is given appropriate outpatient follow-up, and is educated on warning signs (e.g., worsening dyspnea, chest pain, or signs of DVT), discharging her without a contrast-enhanced CT is reasonable.

1. Clinical Presentation and Pretest Probability:  
   • The patient’s symptoms (mild chest pain, vague dyspnea) and vital signs (mild fever, slightly increased heart rate but otherwise stable parameters) do not strongly suggest a massive or submassive pulmonary embolism.  
   • She has no leg swelling or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  

2. Diagnostic Testing Results:  
   • The normal ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan with very low probability of pulmonary embolism is highly reassuring, especially for ruling out a clinically significant PE.  
   • Chest radiograph and ECG are both normal, further lowering the suspicion for serious acute cardiopulmonary processes.  
   • While the D-dimer is borderline, the clearly normal V/Q scan counters the need for additional imaging (CT pulmonary angiogram) in most cases with a sufficiently low or moderate clinical probability.  

3. Safety of Discharge:  
   • Given the overall low suspicion of PE (clinically and by imaging), continuing to pursue a contrast-enhanced CT scan would likely add more radiation and contrast exposure risk without substantial clinical benefit.  
   • Discharging the patient with instructions for close follow-up and prompt return if her symptoms worsen is a safe and rational approach.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the data provided—namely her low‐risk clinical picture, normal or near‐normal V/Q scan, borderline D‐dimer, normal Doppler ultrasound of the legs, and a routine chest radiograph/ECG—it is reasonable to forego a contrast‐enhanced CT scan in this setting. A normal or very low‐probability V/Q scan, in a patient with low or moderate pretest probability, essentially excludes clinically significant pulmonary embolism. 

Accordingly, I would recommend discontinuing unnecessary anticoagulation (assuming no other indications) and discharging her with follow‐up. She can be provided instructions to return if her symptoms worsen or new symptoms (such as more pronounced dyspnea, fever, or hemoptysis) develop. The known risks of contrast (renal injury, allergic reactions) as well as radiation exposure are not justified in this scenario when her overall probability of PE has been effectively ruled out by the normal/very low‐probability V/Q findings and her reassuring clinical profile."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information provided, it appears that a pulmonary embolism (PE) is very unlikely:

• She is clinically stable (heart rate below 100, blood pressure normal, oxygen saturation at 96% on room air).  
• Her ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan shows a very low probability of PE.  
• Lower-extremity Doppler studies are normal.  
• Chest radiograph and ECG are normal.  
• She does not have significant risk factors, unilateral leg swelling/tenderness, or other suggestive features of PE.  

Therefore, in a patient with these findings and without high-risk features (such as hypotension, tachycardia out of proportion, or hypoxia), I would recommend that she can be safely discharged without proceeding to contrast-enhanced chest CT. She should, of course, receive instructions for close outpatient follow-up, warning signs to watch for (such as worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis, or leg swelling), and guidance to return promptly if symptoms worsen."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the clinical picture, the diagnostic workup, and current guidelines, it appears reasonable to forgo a contrast‐enhanced CT scan and to consider discharging this patient with outpatient follow-up. Here is the rationale:

1. Very low probability V/Q scan:  
   • If the chest radiograph is normal and the V/Q scan is interpreted as normal or very low probability, the likelihood of a significant pulmonary embolism is extremely low.  
   • In most diagnostic algorithms, a normal (or very low probability) V/Q scan in the appropriate clinical context can safely exclude clinically relevant pulmonary emboli without further imaging.  

2. Stabilized clinical status:  
   • The patient’s vital signs—while reflecting mild fever and slightly increased respiratory rate—do not suggest severe cardiorespiratory compromise.  
   • Oxygen saturation on room air is 96%, heart rate is below 100 bpm, and blood pressure is stable.  

3. Negative lower extremity Doppler:  
   • While a normal leg ultrasound does not rule out small or isolated pulmonary emboli, it does further lower the clinical suspicion of significant venous thromboembolism.  

4. No alternative high-risk features:  
   • No hemoptysis, no significant risk factors for hypercoagulability reported, and no prior history of deep venous thrombosis or PE.  
   • Normal ECG and normal chest radiograph also reduce concern for acute cardiopulmonary pathology (such as large PE).  

Given these findings, the probability of a clinically significant PE is very low. In most guidelines, a low or very low probability V/Q scan with a normal chest radiograph is sufficient to exclude PE without pursuing contrast-enhanced CT.

Recommendation:  
• Discontinue anticoagulation if clinical judgment confirms that PE is effectively ruled out.  
• Provide symptomatic treatment (e.g., NSAIDs and/or analgesics) for pleuritic chest pain.  
• Arrange close outpatient follow-up to reassess symptoms and review any evolving clinical information.  
• Ensure the patient understands signs or symptoms that would prompt expedited reevaluation (worsening dyspnea, new leg swelling, significant chest pain escalation, or hemodynamic changes).  

Although local practice patterns vary, and some clinicians may obtain a CT pulmonary angiogram for final reassurance, the combination of a normal/very low probability V/Q scan plus the patient’s stable status typically allows for safe discharge without a contrast-enhanced CT scan. If subsequent symptoms worsen or new data suggest a higher index of suspicion for PE, pursuing further imaging could be revisited."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:

Yes, it is reasonable to discharge her without performing a contrast‐enhanced CT scan. A normal (or “very low probability”) ventilation‐perfusion (V/Q) scan in the setting of a normal chest radiograph effectively rules out clinically significant pulmonary embolism in most patients, especially when the pre‐test probability is low. Her clinical presentation is fairly benign (mild tachycardia, no hypoxemia, no unilateral leg findings) and the Doppler ultrasound of the legs is negative. The borderline D‐dimer and normal ECG also support low likelihood of acute pulmonary emboli.

Although she briefly received heparin in the emergency department, a normal/very low probability V/Q scan nearly excludes clinically significant PE, so no further imaging is needed. If her symptoms remain stable or improve, and there are no new risk factors or findings of concern, she can be discharged safely off anticoagulation with close outpatient follow‐up. If her symptoms worsen or risk factors emerge, reevaluation (including possible CT pulmonary angiography) would be warranted."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the available information, I would recommend discharging this patient without obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram. Several key points support this decision:

1. Low-Probability V/Q Scan: The ventilation-perfusion scan is reported as normal/very low probability for pulmonary embolism (PE). In most diagnostic algorithms, a normal or very low probability V/Q scan, especially in a patient with a low pretest clinical suspicion, effectively rules out PE.

2. Normal or Non-Diagnostic Ancillary Tests:
   • Chest radiograph and ECG are normal, which further lowers the likelihood of serious cardiopulmonary pathology.  
   • D-dimer is borderline—not clearly elevated—and generally does not push strongly toward further imaging when other studies suggest a low risk of PE.  
   • Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound is normal, making proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) less likely as a source of emboli.

3. Clinical Picture and Response to NSAIDs:  
   • The patient has relatively stable vital signs (heart rate 96, respiratory rate 21, oxygen saturation 96% on room air). Although there is a low-grade fever (100°F), this can be consistent with a mild viral or inflammatory process.  
   • She reports only two days of pleuritic chest pain with mild dyspnea, no other concerning symptoms (such as significant cough, hemoptysis, or syncope), and she has normal lower extremity findings on exam.  
   • An NSAID injection appears to have helped her symptoms, supporting a possible musculoskeletal or pleuritic etiology.

4. Avoiding Unnecessary Testing:  
   • A CT pulmonary angiogram involves significant radiation and intravenous contrast exposure. For a patient with low clinical suspicion and a normal/very low probability V/Q scan, guidelines typically advise against further imaging.  
   • The additional risks—such as contrast-induced nephropathy or allergic reaction—should be balanced against the low probability of finding an appreciable PE.

In light of these considerations, it is appropriate to discontinue intravenous heparin and discharge this patient with close follow-up, provided she remains clinically stable. Ensure she understands when to return (e.g., worsening chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, new leg swelling, or any other concerning symptoms). Emphasize the importance of compliance with follow-up instructions and of promptly seeking care if her symptoms change or escalate."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:  
Yes. In a low‐risk patient with mild symptoms, normal chest radiograph and ECG, normal or borderline D‐dimer, no ultrasound evidence of deep venous thrombosis, and a ventilation‐perfusion (V/Q) scan read as normal/very low probability, it is safe and appropriate to forego contrast‐enhanced CT imaging and discharge the patient. Close outpatient follow‐up is advisable, with instructions to return if symptoms worsen or new findings (e.g., leg swelling, increasing dyspnea) arise.  

Rationale:  
1. Clinical Probability: Her overall clinical risk for a pulmonary embolism (PE) is low.  
2. Noninvasive Testing:  
   • The V/Q scan showing a normal or very low probability for PE effectively excludes clinically significant emboli in a patient with low pretest probability.  
   • Negative ultrasound of the lower extremities further reduces the likelihood of venous thromboembolism.  
3. Radiation & Contrast Considerations: Performing a CT pulmonary angiogram in the face of very low suspicion for PE adds unnecessary risk from contrast and radiation exposure and is not indicated per most diagnostic algorithms once low‐probability or normal V/Q scan results are obtained.  
4. Clinical Status: She is clinically stable, afebrile to mildly febrile, and maintaining good oxygen saturation on room air.  

Consequently, discharging her without a CT angiogram is appropriate, as long as there is clear instruction for prompt medical re‐evaluation if symptoms progress or change."
