Yes, discharging her without a contrast‐enhanced CT scan appears appropriate given the current information. A normal (or very low‐probability) ventilation‐perfusion (V/Q) scan in a patient with low clinical suspicion effectively rules out clinically significant pulmonary embolism. She is hemodynamically stable, has unremarkable exam findings, and lacks compelling risk factors; the borderline D‐dimer does not override the essentially negative imaging results.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:  
Yes. Given this patient’s clinical picture and investigation findings, I would recommend discharging her without a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram.  

Key Points Supporting This Decision:  
• Very low clinical suspicion: The patient has nonspecific symptoms (mild pleuritic chest pain, mild dyspnea), relatively benign vital signs, and no concerning exam findings (e.g., no leg swelling or tenderness).  
• Normal or very low probability ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan: A normal/very-low-probability V/Q scan effectively rules out clinically significant pulmonary embolism in most situations.  
• Borderline D-dimer without other high-risk indicators: While D-dimer can be mildly elevated or borderline for many reasons, the absence of compatible imaging findings or elevated clinical suspicion reduces its significance here.  
• Unremarkable chest radiograph and ECG: These further lessen concern for acute cardiorespiratory conditions, including pneumonia, significant pulmonary embolism, or acute coronary syndrome as causes.  
• Normal Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities: This reduces the likelihood of deep vein thrombosis as a source of emboli.  

Putting this all together, proceeding with a contrast-enhanced CT scan would not be expected to yield helpful new information and would expose the patient to unnecessary radiation and contrast. A follow-up as an outpatient and reassurance (if her vitals remain stable) is appropriate. If she develops new symptoms or experiences a worsening of symptoms, she can be re-evaluated promptly."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:  
Yes, I would recommend discharging this patient without further contrast-enhanced CT imaging, provided she remains clinically stable.  

Rationale:  
1. Clinical risk assessments can help determine if imaging is needed for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Although she initially presented with possible symptoms (pleuritic chest pain, mild dyspnea), her overall clinical picture leans toward a low pre-test probability:  
   • Mild tachycardia (heart rate of 96), but not overtly tachycardic.  
   • Respiratory rate slightly elevated (21), but oxygen saturation is still 96% on room air.  
   • Temperature is only mildly elevated at 100°F.  

2. Objective data is reassuring:  
   • Chest radiograph is normal.  
   • ECG is normal.  
   • Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities shows no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.  
   • V/Q scan is “normal” and interpreted as very low probability of PE. A normal or near-normal (“very low probability”) V/Q scan in a patient with low or moderate pre-test probability typically excludes pulmonary embolism.  
   • D-dimer is borderline—not definitively high—which further lowers the likelihood of a significant thromboembolic event.

3. Risks of additional imaging:  
   • CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) will expose the patient to intravenous contrast and radiation, which may not be justified given the reassuring clinical picture and normal V/Q scan.  
   • In an older patient, it is prudent to avoid unnecessary contrast when possible.  

Follow-up considerations:  
• Before discharge, ensure she is stable hemodynamically and symptomatically.  
• Educate the patient to return for worsening symptoms (increased shortness of breath, chest pain, new leg swelling, etc.).  
• If there is any clinical change or ongoing diagnostic uncertainty, a repeat evaluation or further imaging can be pursued.  

In summary, with her normal or very low probability V/Q scan, border­line D-dimer, normal Doppler ultrasound, and stable clinical status, it appears safe to forego a contrast-enhanced CT scan and discharge her, with instructions for close follow-up and return precautions."

Here is why:

• Low Clinical Suspicion: She is hemodynamically stable, has no overt risk factors for thromboembolism (e.g., recent surgery, immobilization, malignancy), and exhibits only mild symptoms.  
• “Very Low Probability” Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Scan: A normal or very low probability V/Q scan in a patient with low to moderate pretest probability very reliably excludes clinically significant pulmonary embolism.  
• Normal Ultrasound of the Lower Extremities: Absence of deep venous thrombosis decreases the likelihood of PE further.  
• Borderline D-Dimer: Given her low clinical likelihood and a very low probability V/Q scan, a borderline D-dimer does not, by itself, justify further imaging with contrast.  

After discontinuing heparin, ensure she remains stable off anticoagulation in the ED for a period (e.g., close observation for a few hours). If her vitals remain normal, symptoms are well-controlled, and she has no other concerning findings, she can be discharged home with clear instructions to return for any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or other new symptoms. A short-term follow-up appointment should be arranged to keep an eye on her status."

Given her stable status, absence of other worrisome findings, and a V/Q scan that is effectively “normal,” there is little to be gained from exposing her to further contrast and radiation.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:  
Based on her overall low‐risk presentation (stable vitals, normal ECG and chest radiograph, no leg findings, borderline D‐dimer, normal Doppler ultrasound, and a normal/very‐low‐probability V/Q scan), it is reasonable to forgo contrast‐enhanced CT pulmonary angiography and discharge the patient. The normal/very‐low‐probability V/Q scan in a clinically low‐risk individual is sufficient to exclude significant pulmonary embolism in most cases.  

Rationale:  
1. Clinical Assessment:  
   • She is clinically stable: normal blood pressure, heart rate only mildly elevated, oxygen saturation at 96% on room air.  
   • Pleuritic chest pain and mild dyspnea can be non‐specific; the absence of other risk factors or suggestive findings (no hemoptysis, no suggestive leg findings) reduces suspicion for acute PE.  

2. Diagnostic Testing:  
   • Normal/very‐low‐probability V/Q scan: In a patient with unimpressive clinical risk and a normal or very‐low‐probability V/Q scan, this effectively rules out a clinically significant PE in most circumstances.  
   • Borderline D‐dimer alone, without other support for a high suspicion of PE, does not typically mandate further imaging with CT pulmonary angiography when other tests are unrevealing.  

3. Risk–Benefit Considerations:  
   • Additional radiation and contrast load can be avoided if the probability of finding a PE is exceptionally low.  
   • Patients with stable vitals and normal imaging can usually be managed safely as outpatients if there is no evidence of other acute cardiopulmonary pathology.  

Therefore, unless new information arises to heighten clinical suspicion of a PE, no further imaging with contrast‐enhanced CT is needed, and the patient can be safely discharged (with appropriate outpatient follow‐up and instructions).  "

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information provided, I would recommend discontinuing the workup for pulmonary embolism and discharging the patient without pursuing a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Here is my reasoning:

1. Low clinical suspicion:  
   • She has relatively mild symptoms (two days of pleuritic chest pain, mild dyspnea).  
   • Her vital signs are only slightly abnormal (low-grade fever, mild tachycardia, respiratory rate of 21).  
   • There are no significant findings of deep venous thrombosis on exam (no leg swelling or tenderness).

2. Diagnostic workup suggests very low probability of PE:  
   • Chest radiograph is normal.  
   • ECG is normal.  
   • D-dimer is borderline, which is fairly common in a 65-year-old with nonspecific inflammatory or other minor conditions.  
   • Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities is normal, ruling out significant lower-limb DVT.  
   • Importantly, the ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is reported as normal with a very low probability of embolism. In the context of a relatively low clinical suspicion, a normal or very low-probability V/Q scan is typically sufficient to exclude pulmonary embolism without further imaging.

3. Risks of unnecessary imaging:  
   • A contrast-enhanced CT scan would expose her to additional radiation and potential contrast-related risks.  
   • Given the very low pretest probability and negative V/Q scan, the yield of a CTPA would almost certainly be minimal.

In summary, continuing heparin or pursuing a CT pulmonary angiogram has limited benefit in this setting and may subject her to unnecessary interventions. If her pain improves with NSAIDs and there are no signs of clinical deterioration, she can safely be discharged and advised to follow up if symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear."

Yes. Based on the information provided—low‐risk clinical features, normal/very‐low‐probability ventilation‐perfusion scan, borderline D‐dimer, normal Doppler ultrasound, stable vital signs, and no significant risk factors—it is reasonable to discharge the patient without proceeding to a contrast‐enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram. A truly normal or very‐low‐probability V/Q scan effectively rules out any clinically significant pulmonary embolism in a patient with low (or at most moderate) clinical suspicion.  

Summary of Rationale:  
• Clinical Risk: Overall risk for pulmonary embolism appears low. The patient’s vital signs are relatively stable (heart rate <100, no marked tachypnea, oxygen saturation 96% on room air).  
• Imaging Findings:  
  – Chest radiograph: normal.  
  – ECG: normal.  
  – Ventilation‐perfusion scan: reported as “normal” with “very low probability” for embolism, which essentially excludes a clinically significant PE in a low‐risk setting.  
  – Lower‐extremity Doppler: no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.  
• D‐dimer: Borderline (rather than clearly elevated), which can occur in a variety of conditions and does not necessarily connote a high likelihood of PE in this context.  
• Unnecessary Testing/Risks: A CT pulmonary angiogram would expose the patient to contrast media (renal considerations) and additional radiation, which is not warranted if a normal (or very low probability) V/Q scan aligns with a low pre‐test probability.  

Management & Follow‐Up:  
• Discontinue anticoagulation if there is no other indication.  
• Provide symptomatic relief (e.g., NSAIDs) for pleuritic chest pain.  
• Ensure close outpatient follow‐up to reassess symptoms and vitals.  
• Advise the patient to return if chest pain worsens or if she develops any new or concerning symptoms, such as more significant shortness of breath or hemoptysis.

Based on the normal (very low–probability) V/Q scan, normal chest radiograph, and overall low clinical suspicion of PE, I would recommend against further contrast‐enhanced CTA and favor discharging her without additional imaging.

Rationale:  
1. V/Q findings: A normal or very low–probability ventilation–perfusion scan, in the context of a normal chest radiograph and relatively low pretest probability, effectively rules out clinically significant pulmonary embolism in most cases.  

2. Clinical stability: Her vital signs are acceptable (heart rate < 100, BP 130/85, SpO₂ 96% on room air), and there are no signs of significant hemodynamic compromise or deep vein thrombosis (normal lower-extremity Doppler).  

3. Utility of CT: A contrast‐enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram is generally reserved for patients in whom noninvasive tests (e.g., D‐dimer, V/Q scan) are nondiagnostic or strongly at odds with a high clinical suspicion. In this case, with a normal V/Q scan and stable clinical status, the additional yield of contrast CT would be very low.  

4. Risks of unnecessary imaging: Avoiding an unneeded CT scan is prudent, especially in an older adult, to reduce radiation exposure and the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy or other adverse effects.  

Conclusion:  
Given the reassuring test results and low clinical likelihood of pulmonary embolism, it is reasonable to discharge her without pursuing a contrast‐enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram. Of course, she should receive clear instructions to follow up promptly if symptoms worsen or change."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the clinical information and the workup performed thus far, I would recommend against further imaging with a contrast‐enhanced CT scan and would feel comfortable discharging her.

Here is how I arrive at that recommendation:

1. Clinical Presentation & Risk:  
   • She is hemodynamically stable, has only mild tachycardia (HR in the 90s), and no hypoxia (oxygen saturation 96% on room air).  
   • Her only notable symptom is pleuritic chest pain with mild dyspnea, which can have many benign causes.  
   • There is no mention of a significant prior history of thrombosis, malignancy, recent surgery, or other major predisposing factors.

2. Diagnostic Workup:  
   • Normal/Very‐Low‐Probability V/Q Scan: A “normal” or “very low probability” result is highly reliable in ruling out a clinically significant pulmonary embolism in a patient with low to moderate clinical suspicion.  
   • Negative Lower‐Extremity Doppler Ultrasound: The absence of DVT on ultrasound lowers the likelihood of an embolic source.  
   • Borderline D‐dimer: Slightly elevated or borderline D‐dimers can occur for many reasons (advancing age, mild inflammation, etc.). In the context of a negative imaging workup, this does not itself mandate further scanning.  

3. Potential Risks of CTA:  
   • Contrast nephropathy, especially in older patients or those with potential renal impairment.  
   • Radiation exposure, which is not negligible in contrast CT studies.  

Given the low clinical suspicion and negative‐to‐very‐low‐probability imaging workup (V/Q scan and Doppler), a CT pulmonary angiogram is unlikely to add diagnostic value. Discharging her with appropriate outpatient follow‐up, analgesia for her pleuritic pain (which may be musculoskeletal or viral in origin), and clear instructions to return if symptoms worsen or new findings develop is a reasonable and safe plan. It also avoids unnecessary contrast, radiation exposure, and hospital resource utilization.

Thus, I would discontinue intravenous heparin and arrange for her discharge home without proceeding to a contrast‐enhanced CT scan, unless her clinical picture were to change significantly."

Given the patient’s overall low clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism, normal chest radiograph, borderline D-dimer, normal lower-extremity Doppler ultrasound, and, most importantly, a “normal/very low probability” ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan on a clear chest radiograph, I would not pursue a CT pulmonary angiogram in this scenario. The existing workup effectively excludes a significant pulmonary embolism, and the patient appears hemodynamically stable with only mild symptoms. Therefore, if no other concerning findings emerge, it would be reasonable to discontinue unnecessary anticoagulation and arrange outpatient follow-up rather than obtain a contrast-enhanced CT scan. 

In practice, before finalizing discharge, I would:
• Ensure vital signs remain stable (particularly heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation).  
• Verify no new symptoms have appeared.  
• Confirm the patient has reliable follow-up.  
• Provide clear discharge instructions regarding warning signs (worsening chest pain, increased shortness of breath, etc.) that would prompt immediate return to the emergency department.

Otherwise, the risk-benefit profile does not favor further imaging, and discharge would be appropriate."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:  
Yes. In most scenarios, a truly normal or very low probability ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan virtually excludes clinically significant pulmonary embolism in a patient with a non-high clinical suspicion. Given her stable presentation, normal vital signs, and a V/Q scan that suggests very low likelihood of embolism, it is reasonable to discharge her without pursuing a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram. She can be managed expectantly as an outpatient, assuming no other concerning findings arise and she remains clinically stable.  

Rationale:  
• Very Low Probability V/Q Scan: A normal or very low probability V/Q scan generally rules out significant pulmonary embolism in patients who do not have a high pretest probability.  
• Mild Clinical Presentation: Although she has pleuritic chest pain and borderline D-dimer, her vital signs are relatively stable, and she has no other high-risk features (e.g., persistent tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia).  
• Absence of DVT Findings: Her lower-extremity Doppler ultrasound is normal, reducing the likelihood of ongoing venous thromboembolism.  
• Low-Risk Profile: Her age and mild fever may slightly elevate suspicion, but her normal ECG and normal chest radiograph—combined with clinical stability—support an overall low-risk profile.  

If there is any change in her clinical status or emergent concern for alternative diagnoses, outpatient follow-up and re-evaluation may be warranted. Otherwise, given the information supplied, discharging her without further imaging is appropriate."

1. Clinical Presentation and Stability  
   • The patient’s vital signs are relatively stable: heart rate under 100 bpm, blood pressure normal, oxygen saturation at 96% on room air.  
   • She exhibits only mild, vague dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain, without more worrisome features such as significant tachycardia, hypotension, pronounced hypoxia, or hemoptysis.  

2. Noninvasive Testing  
   • The chest radiograph is normal and the ECG does not show any acute abnormalities suggestive of pulmonary embolism.  
   • Her lower-extremity Doppler ultrasound is negative—further decreasing the likelihood of a deep venous thrombus as the source of pulmonary emboli.  
   • A “normal” or “very low probability” ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan in a patient whose clinical suspicion for PE is not high has good negative predictive value and typically rules out PE.  
   • Although the D-dimer is “borderline,” a normal (or very low probability) V/Q scan in a patient with low to intermediate clinical suspicion is usually sufficient to exclude chronic or acute pulmonary embolism.  

3. Conclusion and Recommendation  
   • Given that the noninvasive workup (including the V/Q scan) aligns with a very low probability of pulmonary embolism, the added radiation and renal risk from a CT pulmonary angiogram is generally not justified.  
   • If the patient remains stable, has no escalation of symptoms, and her clinical suspicion for PE is consistently low, she can be safely discharged with appropriate follow-up and instructions to return if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.  

In summary, her current imaging and clinical picture strongly suggest the absence of a pulmonary embolism, and no further contrast-enhanced imaging appears necessary."

A normal or near-normal V/Q scan (with “very low probability” reported) has a high negative predictive value for ruling out clinically significant PE in patients without high-risk features. Additionally:  
• Her vital signs are relatively stable (HR <100, RR borderline but not severely elevated, O2 sat adequate on room air).  
• No unilateral leg swelling was found on clinical exam, and the lower-extremity Doppler ultrasound is negative.  
• The chest radiograph is unremarkable, and the ECG does not suggest an alternative worrisome diagnosis.  
• Her d-dimer, though “borderline,” is not strongly positive in a manner that would override the very low probability imaging finding.  

A CT pulmonary angiogram is a valuable tool if the suspicion for PE remains moderate to high or if conflicting data suggest that a normal or low-probability V/Q scan might be falsely reassuring. However, in this scenario—stable patient, essentially normal noninvasive workup, and a normal/very low probability V/Q scan—it is reasonable to avoid additional radiation and contrast exposure by foregoing a CT pulmonary angiogram.

1. Discontinuing empirical intravenous heparin (as the risk of anticoagulation may now exceed its benefit in light of the low likelihood of PE).

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Below is a general discussion and a sample recommendation based on typical clinical reasoning. This information is for educational purposes and should not replace clinical judgment or local guidelines. Always consider your patient’s full history, risk factors, and current presentation.

Clinical Reasoning

1. Clinical Probability:  
   • The patient’s presentation (pleuritic chest pain, mild dyspnea, borderline D-dimer, no other significant symptoms or risk factors) puts her at relatively low or possibly moderate suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE).  
   • No leg swelling or tenderness on exam, which makes deep venous thrombosis (and hence PE) less likely, though not definitively ruled out by exam alone.

2. Imaging and Laboratory Findings:  
   • Normal chest radiograph and ECG reduce the likelihood of acute cardiopulmonary pathology such as pneumonia, significant lung consolidation, or acute coronary syndrome.  
   • A ventilatory-perfusion (V/Q) scan that is read as “normal” or “very low probability” typically confers a high negative predictive value for PE—especially if the clinical suspicion is low to moderate.  
   • Borderline D-dimer: In an older population, D-dimer can be elevated for many reasons. Borderline or slightly elevated results, when other evidence of PE is lacking, usually do not mandate further imaging if the V/Q scan and clinical scenario strongly argue against PE.

3. CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) Considerations:  
   • The main benefit of a CTPA in this context is definitively ruling out PE when clinical or imaging findings are ambiguous. However, a truly normal or very low-probability V/Q scan, combined with a low pre-test clinical probability, often makes further imaging unnecessary.  
   • Potential downsides of a CTPA include contrast-induced nephropathy (especially in older patients or those with renal insufficiency), radiation exposure, and cost/resource utilization.

Recommendation

Based on the normal (very low-probability) V/Q scan, absence of significant risk factors, and relatively mild symptoms, it would be reasonable to consider that pulmonary embolism is effectively ruled out. In many clinical guidelines, a normal or very low-probability V/Q scan in a patient without high clinical suspicion often excludes acute PE to a safe degree.

Accordingly, unless there is a sudden change in clinical status, a strong clinical suspicion unaccounted for, or other concerning findings, it would be reasonable to discharge the patient without performing a contrast-enhanced CT (CTPA). Of note, ensuring good outpatient follow-up is important:  
• Advise the patient to return for any worsening chest pain, new shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms.  
• Arrange prompt outpatient follow-up (e.g., with primary care or pulmonology) if musculoskeletal pain, pleurisy, or other diagnoses remain uncertain.  
• Consider reevaluation of other potential causes of pleuritic chest discomfort, such as pericarditis, costochondritis, or other cardiopulmonary etiologies.

Clinical judgment should guide the ultimate decision, incorporating the patient’s preferences, any evolving clinical signs, and local protocols. If uncertainty persists or new risk factors emerge, a contrast-enhanced CT scan can still be pursued on a case-by-case basis.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","I have reviewed the patient’s presentation, vital signs, laboratory tests, and imaging results. In particular, her normal (very low probability) ventilation-perfusion scan effectively rules out clinically significant pulmonary embolism, especially given her relatively benign clinical course: stable vital signs, adequate oxygen saturation, and no findings on Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities.

While her D-dimer is “borderline,” a normal (or very low probability) V/Q scan has a high negative predictive value for pulmonary embolism, often making further contrast-based imaging (such as a CT pulmonary angiogram) unnecessary in a hemodynamically stable patient with low to moderate clinical suspicion. Exposing her to contrast and additional radiation does not seem justified if there are no other concerning features. In this scenario—and based on standard guidelines—most clinicians would feel comfortable excluding a pulmonary embolism without proceeding to a CT pulmonary angiogram.

Therefore, I would recommend:
• Discontinuing the intravenous heparin if pulmonary embolism is no longer suspected.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to forego a contrast‐enhanced CT scan and discharge the patient with appropriate outpatient follow-up. A normal (very low probability) ventilation‐perfusion scan effectively rules out clinically significant pulmonary embolism in most cases, especially in a stable patient with borderline/low‐risk clinical features and a normal workup otherwise.

Key points supporting discharge without a CT pulmonary angiogram:  
• Normal (or very low probability) V/Q scan in a patient whose clinical picture is not suggestive of an acute PE.  
• Stable vital signs with no high-risk findings (e.g., no marked tachycardia, hypoxia, hemodynamic instability).  
• Normal lower-extremity Doppler ultrasound and only borderline D-dimer.  
• Lack of overt risk factors and a nonconcerning physical exam.  

Exposing her to more radiation and intravenous contrast would be unwarranted in the face of a negative V/Q scan and an otherwise reassuring clinical profile. Close outpatient follow-up to ensure symptom resolution, along with instructions to return for any worsening, would be the appropriate course."

A normal (or very low‐probability) ventilation‐perfusion (V/Q) scan in combination with her relatively benign presentation, stable vital signs, and normal Doppler ultrasound studies collectively make acute pulmonary embolism highly unlikely. 

Specifically, a normal or “very low probability” V/Q scan provides strong negative predictive value for clinically significant pulmonary embolism when correlated with a low to moderate clinical suspicion. Although the D‐dimer is borderline, the overall clinical context—particularly her hemodynamic stability, lack of significant hypoxia, and non‐suggestive lower‐extremity Doppler findings—supports ruling out substantial pulmonary thromboembolism. 

In this circumstance, additional radiation exposure and contrast load from a CT pulmonary angiogram would likely not add meaningful diagnostic or therapeutic information.

Unless a new concern emerges (such as a rising temperature, hypoxia, or a high-probability clinical scenario for PE), it would be reasonable to stop anticoagulation and consider discharging her.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:  
Yes. Given her low‐probability clinical presentation and a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan that is reported as normal (i.e., very low probability), I would recommend stopping the heparin and discharging her without proceeding to contrast-enhanced CT scanning.

Rationale:  
1. Low Clinical Suspicion:  
   • She is clinically stable (normal blood pressure, normal oxygen saturation, and only mild dyspnea).  
   • She has no evidence of deep venous thrombosis on Doppler ultrasound.  
   • Her D‐dimer is only borderline elevated, which can occur with a variety of mild inflammatory states.

2. Diagnostic Workup Already Lowers Probability:  
   • A normal V/Q scan (particularly one interpreted as “very low probability”) makes pulmonary embolism unlikely in a patient who does not otherwise have high-risk factors.  
   • The normal chest radiograph and ECG further reduce likelihood of significant cardiopulmonary pathology.

3. Avoid Unnecessary Risks:  
   • In the setting of a reassuring clinical picture and a very low‐probability scan, additional imaging (CT pulmonary angiogram) would likely add more radiation, cost, and potential for contrast-induced complications than practical benefit.

4. Follow-Up Plan:  
   • She can be discharged with instructions to follow up promptly for any concerning changes, such as worsening dyspnea or new symptoms.  
   • Outpatient reevaluation provides an additional safety net without exposing her to unnecessary diagnostic risks now.

In summary, with a reassuring history, normal V/Q scan, and no objective evidence of venous thromboembolism, it is reasonable to discontinue anticoagulation and allow discharge without further imaging."

Rationale:  
• Her overall clinical picture and vital signs (near‐normal heart rate, no significant tachypnea, preserved oxygen saturation) suggest a low probability of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).  
• A ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scan reported as normal with very low probability of embolism effectively rules out clinically significant PE, especially in the setting of a normal chest radiograph and borderline (rather than definitively positive) D-dimer.  
• Negative Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities further decreases the likelihood of a significant venous thromboembolism source.  
• Given the above, obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram is unlikely to change management or yield a new diagnosis—exposing the patient unnecessarily to intravenous contrast and radiation.  

Therefore, it is reasonable to discontinue anticoagulation (IV heparin), forgo the CT pulmonary angiogram, and discharge the patient with appropriate follow-up instructions.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the clinical findings and the reported imaging results, I would recommend against pursuing a contrast‐enhanced CT scan in this situation and would instead feel comfortable discharging her. Here is my reasoning:

1. Clinical Stability and Low Suspicion:  
• She is hemodynamically stable (heart rate <100, blood pressure within normal limits, respirations only slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation at 96% on room air).  
• No focal findings suggestive of deep venous thrombosis on exam or ultrasound.  

2. Diagnostic Workup So Far:  
• Chest radiograph and ECG are normal.  
• D‐dimer is borderline, but that by itself does not mandate further tests when other findings lower the overall probability.  
• Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is read as normal or very low probability, which effectively rules out a clinically significant pulmonary embolism in the setting of a normal chest x-ray and otherwise low clinical suspicion.  

3. Clinical Guidelines and Interpretation:  
• Established guidelines indicate that a normal or very low probability V/Q scan, in a patient with low or intermediate clinical suspicion, essentially excludes PE.  
• Therefore, a confirmatory CT pulmonary angiogram would likely expose her to unnecessary radiation and contrast without meaningfully altering management.  

Hence, my clear recommendation is to discontinue the intravenous heparin, not proceed with a contrast-enhanced CT scan, and arrange safe outpatient follow-up. She may be discharged if she remains clinically stable, is educated on warning signs (such as worsening shortness of breath, persistent chest pain, or new leg swelling), and has a reliable means of returning quickly for re-evaluation if needed."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the clinical picture and the diagnostic information obtained so far, I would recommend discontinuing the workup for pulmonary embolism and proceeding with discharge without a contrast‑enhanced CT scan. Here is my rationale:

1. Clinical Presentation and Vital Signs:  
   • The patient’s vital signs (heart rate 96, BP 130/85, respiratory rate 21, oxygen saturation 96% on room air) are relatively stable.  
   • She has only mild dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain, with no hemoptysis, no leg swelling on exam, and no concerning past medical history.  

2. Negative or Very Low-Probability V/Q Scan:  
   • A “normal” or “very low‑probability” ventilation‑perfusion scan in the context of low or moderate clinical suspicion effectively rules out a clinically significant pulmonary embolism in most cases.  
   • Because the V/Q scan is highly sensitive for larger or more central emboli, a “very low probability” study typically excludes the need for further imaging in a patient who is hemodynamically stable and whose overall presentation is not highly suspicious for PE.  

3. Other Tests Support Low Likelihood of PE:  
   • Her borderline D‑dimer—while not definitively negative—does not override the normal V/Q scan in a low‑to‑moderate pretest probability scenario.  
   • The lower‑extremity Doppler ultrasound is normal, reducing the likelihood of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as a source of PE.  
   • Normal ECG and chest radiograph decrease suspicion for alternative acute cardiopulmonary processes that might mimic a PE (e.g., large pneumonia, significant pleural effusion, acute coronary syndrome).

4. Risks of Unnecessary CT Pulmonary Angiogram:  
   • Contrast‑induced nephropathy and radiation exposure are important considerations; avoiding a CT when it is unlikely to change management is sensible, especially in older patients.  
   • Given her stable respiratory status and lack of high‑risk features, the benefit of CT imaging is minimal compared to the potential risks.

5. Discharge with Follow‑Up:  
   • If, upon clinical re-evaluation, she has stable symptoms and no new warning signs, discontinuation of heparin and discharge home with oral NSAIDs for pleuritic pain would be appropriate.  
   • Advise her to return promptly if she develops worsening chest pain, more significant dyspnea, leg swelling, or any other concerning symptoms.

In summary, the combination of a normal or low‑probability V/Q scan, low (or at most moderate) clinical suspicion, stable vitals, and no evidence of DVT essentially rules out a clinically significant acute pulmonary embolism. Barring any change in her condition or new data suggesting higher risk, discharging her without obtaining a CT pulmonary angiogram is both reasonable and consistent with most diagnostic algorithms for suspected PE."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:  
Yes. In this scenario, discharging the patient without proceeding to a contrast-enhanced CT scan seems reasonable.

Rationale:  
1. Very low probability (essentially normal) V/Q scan: A normal or very low probability ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan in the appropriate clinical context is generally sufficient to rule out an acute pulmonary embolism.  
2. Stable vital signs: The patient’s heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation are all acceptable, which reduces concern for an acute, life-threatening cardiopulmonary process.  
3. Low clinical suspicion: She has no limb swelling or tenderness (i.e., no obvious deep venous thrombosis), no hemoptysis, and her symptoms (pleuritic chest pain) can often be explained by less serious conditions such as pleurisy or musculoskeletal pain.  
4. Normal secondary studies: A normal chest X-ray and ECG, along with a borderline D-dimer (which can be influenced by age), diminish the likelihood of a significant acute thromboembolism.  
5. Avoid unnecessary radiation and contrast: Performing a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) would expose the patient to additional radiation and contrast material risks, which are not justified if you have already excluded clinically significant pulmonary embolism through a low-probability V/Q scan and normal supportive studies.

Follow-up:  
1. Ensure symptom control with NSAIDs or other appropriate analgesics.  
2. Provide clear instructions to return if symptoms worsen or new symptoms (e.g., worsening shortness of breath, hemoptysis, leg swelling) arise.  
3. Arrange close outpatient follow-up, ensuring that she has timely access for re-evaluation if needed.

Final note:  
Given the strong negative predictive value of a normal or very low-probability V/Q scan in a hemodynamically stable patient, it is appropriate to forgo the CT pulmonary angiogram and safely discharge her with instructions for outpatient follow-up."

2. Non-diagnostic but reassuring workup so far. A normal ECG, normal chest radiograph, borderline D-dimer (which can be slightly elevated for a variety of reasons in older adults), and a Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities that is negative for DVT collectively reduce the likelihood of PE.  
3. V/Q scan findings. A normal/very low probability V/Q scan in a patient with low clinical suspicion is generally sufficient to exclude pulmonary embolism, obviating the need for a CT pulmonary angiogram in most cases.  

Plan:  
• Stop anticoagulation if there are no other indications for its continuation (e.g., no confirmed thromboembolism).  
• Provide symptomatic treatment (e.g., NSAIDs, analgesics).  
• Ensure appropriate outpatient follow-up—either with primary care or a follow-up imaging study only if symptoms worsen or new risk factors arise.  
• Reinforce return precautions if breathing difficulties or other concerning symptoms develop.  

With this approach, the small risk of missing a clinically significant pulmonary embolism is outweighed by the safety and evidence-based practice of avoiding unnecessary radiation and contrast exposure when the clinical likelihood and V/Q scan findings do not support further imaging."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation (for educational purposes only and not as a substitute for individual clinical judgment):

In an otherwise healthy patient with low clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE), normal or near-normal vital signs, and a normal/very low probability ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan, the likelihood of a significant PE is extremely low. Given that her V/Q scan is essentially negative and that her clinical presentation is mild, it is generally reasonable to forgo a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram in this scenario.

If she remains hemodynamically stable and her symptoms are improving, I would recommend discontinuing intravenous heparin (assuming no other indication for anticoagulation) and arranging close outpatient follow-up rather than proceeding with CT angiography. Of course, further inpatient evaluation or imaging may be prudent if new signs or symptoms develop (e.g. worsening respiratory status, tachycardia, hypoxia) or if clinical suspicion unexpectedly rises.

Key points supporting discharge without contrast-enhanced CT:
• The patient’s pre-test probability appears quite low (e.g., no concerning findings on exam, low Wells/PERC criteria, and mild symptoms).
• A normal or very low probability V/Q scan has excellent negative predictive value for PE.
• Normal chest radiograph and normal ECG further lower the likelihood of alternative acute cardiopulmonary causes.
• Borderline D-dimer, in context of low clinical suspicion and negative imaging, does not itself mandate further imaging.

Close outpatient follow-up instructions should include returning promptly for new or worsening symptoms, especially increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or signs of deep vein thrombosis."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information you have provided, I would recommend discharging this patient without proceeding to a contrast-enhanced CT scan. Here is the reasoning:

1. Clinical Picture and Vital Signs  
   • The patient’s vital signs are relatively stable: her heart rate is under 100 bpm, respiratory rate is only slightly elevated at 21, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.  
   • Although she describes 2 days of pleuritic chest pain and some vague dyspnea, there are no high-risk features (such as marked hypoxia, tachycardia >100 bpm, or hemodynamic instability).  

2. Diagnostic Test Findings So Far  
   • D-dimer: Although borderline, this alone should not drive the decision to pursue further imaging if everything else is reassuring.  
   • Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Scan: Reported as normal with very low probability of pulmonary embolism. A truly normal or very low probability V/Q scan in a patient who is not high-risk means that PE is essentially ruled out.  
   • Doppler Ultrasound lower extremities: Normal, reducing the likelihood of a deep vein thrombosis source for pulmonary emboli.  
   • Chest Radiograph: Normal, which supports the very low probability indicated by the V/Q scan.  
   • ECG: Normal, which—while not definitive—also reduces concern for acute cardiopulmonary pathology such as significant PE or ischemic changes.  

3. Overall Pretest Probability  
   • Given the low-to-moderate pretest probability clinically and a normal (or very low probability) scan, combined with stable vital signs and no evidence of DVT, the likelihood of acute pulmonary embolism is very low.  

4. Risks of Unnecessary CT Scan  
   • IV contrast media can pose a risk to renal function, especially in older adults.  
   • Radiation exposure from CT pulmonary angiography is not inconsequential.  

5. Conclusion and Disposition  
   • Because all key indicators point to a very low likelihood of PE, further imaging with a contrast CT scan is unlikely to add benefit.  
   • She can safely be discharged with follow-up instructions for any worsening symptoms.  
   • NSAIDs for pain control and reassurance appear sufficient.  
   • Instruct the patient to return promptly if she develops clearer signs of pulmonary or cardiac compromise (such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain at rest, hemoptysis, or hypoxia).  

Therefore, there is no strong indication to proceed with a contrast-enhanced CT scan in this setting, and discharging the patient—after clinical reassurance and instructions for red flags—would be best."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information provided, I would recommend that you do not pursue a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram and, instead, discharge the patient. A “normal” or “very low probability” ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan effectively excludes clinically significant pulmonary embolism in a patient whose clinical risk (by history, exam, and borderline D‑dimer) is otherwise low. 

Key reasoning points include:
• She is hemodynamically stable, with no evidence of severe hypoxia or tachycardia.  
• A normal V/Q scan in a low- to intermediate-probability clinical scenario has a high negative predictive value for PE.  
• Her D-dimer is only borderline (and might be explained by other factors); she does not have leg swelling or other high-risk findings.  
• She has a normal chest radiograph and normal ECG.  

Therefore, continuing to pursue a contrast-enhanced CT of the pulmonary arteries in this setting routinely risks unnecessary radiation and contrast load without substantially improving diagnostic certainty. Given that the V/Q scan is “very low probability” for pulmonary embolism, you can safely discontinue anticoagulation and arrange appropriate outpatient follow-up.  

No further acute inpatient workup is indicated for PE, and you can direct your efforts toward ensuring her mild symptoms (pleuritic pain) are managed and that any alternative benign causes (e.g., musculoskeletal or pleuritic etiology) are followed up in the outpatient setting.  "

Normal or very-low-probability results on a ventilation-perfusion scan—especially in a patient with low clinical suspicion and no worrisome findings on exam or supporting tests—virtually exclude acute pulmonary embolism. A normal chest radiograph and a non-diagnostic (i.e., borderline) D-dimer further reduce the likelihood of PE. Consequently, continuing to pursue contrast imaging would expose the patient to unnecessary risk (contrast load, radiation) with minimal expected diagnostic yield.

In practice, of course, there should be clear instructions for outpatient follow-up. If she develops any new or concerning symptoms (worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope) after discharge, or if other risk factors emerge, re-evaluation would be warranted. However, at this time, the preponderance of evidence suggests that discharging her without a CT scan is appropriate."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Recommendation:  
Yes. In this scenario, I would recommend discharging the patient without obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram.

Rationale:  
• Low-probability imaging: The ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is reported as normal/very low probability, which strongly argues against acute pulmonary embolism in most clinical contexts.  
• Frame the pre-test probability: She has few clinical risk factors and a borderline D-dimer, making her likelihood of pulmonary embolism low, especially in the setting of a normal V/Q scan.  
• Limited value of additional imaging: A CT pulmonary angiogram in the face of a normal or very low-probability V/Q scan adds radiation and contrast exposure with a low probability of revealing new information.  
• Clinical follow-up: She has relatively stable vitals and only mild symptoms. Arranging prompt outpatient follow-up—with instructions to return for any worsening symptoms—offers a safe way to monitor her condition without over-investigating.  

Accordingly, it is reasonable to discontinue anticoagulation, manage her pleuritic pain (e.g., with NSAIDs, as already initiated), provide reassurance, and discharge her with close follow-up.  "

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","I would lean toward recommending discharge without proceeding to a contrast-enhanced CT scan, provided the patient remains clinically stable and has appropriate follow-up arranged. Here is the clinical reasoning:

1. Overall Probability of Pulmonary Embolism (PE):  
   • The ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is interpreted as normal/very low probability, which typically rules out an acute, clinically significant PE in the setting of low-to-moderate clinical suspicion.  
   • The patient’s recent Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities did not show deep vein thrombosis (DVT), further reducing the likelihood of PE.  
   • Although the D-dimer is borderline, the normal/low-probability V/Q scan carries considerable weight in excluding PE when clinical suspicion is not high.  

2. Clinical Stability:  
   • The patient’s vital signs are fairly stable—heart rate 96 bpm, blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.  
   • She is afebrile or only mildly febrile (100°F) and has no hypoxia or significant tachycardia.  

3. Symptom Profile:  
   • She complains primarily of pleuritic chest pain with mild dyspnea and no cough or hemoptysis.  
   • No unilateral leg swelling or tenderness is noted, thus lowering the pre-test probability of DVT/PE.  

4. Role of CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA):  
   • CTPA is very useful when the probability of PE is intermediate or high, or if a V/Q scan is indeterminate/nondiagnostic.  
   • In this scenario, with a normal/very low-probability V/Q scan and stable vitals, CTPA is less likely to change management.  

Recommendations and Caveats:  
• Before discharge, ensure that the chest pain is not worsening and that no other serious causes of chest pain (such as coronary artery disease or other cardiopulmonary conditions) need further evaluation.  
• Confirm the patient’s reliability for outpatient follow-up.  
• Given the borderline D-dimer, it can be prudent to ensure no subtle changes in vital signs or clinical condition occur over a short observation period.  
• If the patient’s symptoms evolve or worsen, or if new risk factors come to light, re-evaluation might be necessary.

As always, management decisions should be individualized, and other etiologies of chest pain (e.g., musculoskeletal, pericarditis, or other conditions) should be considered if symptoms persist or change. However, based on the information provided—stability, normal/very low-probability V/Q scan, and no evidence of DVT—discharging the patient without a CT pulmonary angiogram seems reasonable with a clear safety net and appropriate follow-up instructions in place.

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on her presentation (mild symptoms, stable vital signs, normal V/Q scan, and no other strong clinical risk factors), I would recommend against further contrast-enhanced imaging and support discharging her with appropriate outpatient follow-up.

Below is the reasoning:

1. Clinical Stability and Low Suspicion:  
   • She has remained hemodynamically stable with only mild dyspnea and mild pleuritic chest pain.  
   • Temperature is only slightly elevated, and all other vitals are within acceptable ranges.  

2. Noninvasive Workup Suggests Low PE Probability:  
   • Her ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is normal with very low probability of pulmonary embolism. A normal or near-normal V/Q scan is highly reassuring and generally excludes clinically significant PE.  
   • Her D-dimer, although borderline, is not definitively high, nor is there other strong evidence of thromboembolism.  
   • Lower-extremity Doppler ultrasound is normal, making a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) less likely.  

3. Risks of Unnecessary Imaging:  
   • A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) adds radiation exposure and contrast-related risks, especially in the absence of a high clinical suspicion.  
   • Current guidelines often permit ruling out PE with a low or very low probability V/Q scan when clinical suspicion is low or moderate.  

4. Next Steps in Management:  
   • Since life-threatening causes of chest pain (e.g., pulmonary embolism) appear very unlikely, she can be transitioned off intravenous heparin before discharge (unless there is another compelling indication for ongoing anticoagulation).  
   • Advise outpatient follow-up and ensure she knows to return if her symptoms worsen or new concerning symptoms arise.  

In summary, given her stable condition, low-risk profile, and completely reassuring testing (particularly the normal V/Q scan), there would be no strong indication to proceed with a contrast-enhanced CT. Therefore, she can be safely discharged without a CTPA, provided good follow-up is in place."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the information given, I would recommend discharging this patient without proceeding to a contrast‐enhanced CT scan, provided that she is clinically stable and has reliable outpatient follow‐up. Here is the rationale:

1. Low clinical probability:  
   • She has minimal symptoms (mild vague dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain) with overall stable vital signs and no significant past medical history.  
   • Physical exam does not suggest an alternative acute cardiopulmonary cause (e.g., no leg findings to suggest deep venous thrombosis).

2. Negative or low‐probability workup for pulmonary embolism:  
   • Her ventilation‐perfusion (V/Q) scan is reported as normal, indicating a very low probability of pulmonary embolism.  
   • Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities is normal.  
   • Her D‐dimer is borderline (neither convincingly elevated nor definitively low), but when taken in context of her normal V/Q scan, she is unlikely to have a significant pulmonary embolism.

3. Avoiding unnecessary imaging:  
   • A contrast‐enhanced CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) adds radiation exposure and contrast load. In a patient with a normal V/Q scan, performing a CTPA typically does not add significant diagnostic value for ruling out PE.  
   • If she remains stable, with normal oxygenation and normal hemodynamic parameters, further diagnostic imaging for PE is unlikely to change management.

4. Safe outpatient strategy:  
   • She can be discharged with thorough instructions to return promptly if she develops worsening respiratory symptoms, hemodynamic changes, or any new concerning symptoms such as hemoptysis.  
   • Arranging close outpatient follow‐up—possibly with her primary care provider or a pulmonologist—helps ensure her clinical status is re‐evaluated soon.

Of course, if additional concerns arise (e.g., increased shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypoxia, abnormal chest imaging later), a repeat assessment or further imaging might be warranted. But, with the current data (very low probability V/Q scan) and a stable clinical picture, I believe it is both reasonable and safe to forego the CT scan and discharge her with appropriate follow‐up."

Would you recommend discharging the patient without a contrast-enhanced CT scan?.","Based on the clinical picture and the available diagnostic data, I would recommend discharging this patient without proceeding to a contrast-enhanced CT scan. Here is my reasoning:

1. Low Probability Imaging Results:  
   • The ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan was reported as normal to very low probability. This finding alone makes the likelihood of a clinically significant pulmonary embolism (PE) exceedingly small.

2. Borderline D-Dimer in Context:  
   • D-dimer can be mildly elevated or borderline for a variety of reasons, especially among older adults. When a normal/low-probability V/Q scan accompanies a borderline D-dimer, it typically rules out a large, clinically significant PE.

3. Stable Clinical Status:  
   • The patient’s vital signs (heart rate of 96, normal blood pressure, respiratory rate only modestly elevated, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air) suggest hemodynamic stability. There are no signs of deep venous thrombosis (lower-extremity Doppler ultrasound studies are normal, and physical examination does not reveal leg swelling or tenderness).

4. Alternative Explanation for Symptoms:  
   • Mild pleuritic chest pain and vague dyspnea can often be caused by benign conditions such as musculoskeletal strain or viral pleurisy, especially when imaging studies have effectively ruled out PE.

5. Risks of Unnecessary CT Angiography:  
   • Contrast-enhanced CT adds radiation exposure and the potential risks of IV contrast (e.g., nephrotoxicity) without substantial diagnostic benefit, given the extremely low post-test probability of PE.

Recommendation:
• Discontinue heparin (unless new information arises that increases suspicion for PE).  
• Provide an appropriate alternative explanation and symptomatic management (e.g., continue NSAIDs for pleuritic pain, ensure follow-up).  
• Discharge the patient with clear instructions to return should her symptoms worsen or new symptoms (e.g., leg swelling, hemoptysis, or increased shortness of breath) develop.  

In this setting, the combination of a normal/very low probability V/Q scan and a stable clinical picture makes further imaging with contrast-enhanced CT unnecessary. Discharging her with close outpatient follow-up is a prudent and safe course of action."
