Please provide a probability estimate. SR is a 27-year-old ICU nurse who has not received a COVID vaccination yet. She now has a fever, fatigue, and sore throat. SR is tested for COVID and will receive results in 1-2 days. At her location, an average of 10% of COVID tests are positive. SR is also tested for mononucleosis, those results are fast, and those results are positive (she does have mononucleosis).
Are the chances SR has COVID above or below 10%?.","Based on the information provided, it is more likely that SR’s chance of having COVID is below the local average of 10%. Although SR’s work in an ICU and lack of vaccination do increase her baseline risk somewhat, her positive mononucleosis test provides a strong alternative explanation for her current symptoms (fever, fatigue, sore throat). While there is always some possibility of co-infection, the presence of a confirmed cause (mononucleosis) makes a new or separate COVID infection less probable than it would be in someone with similar symptoms but no clear alternative diagnosis."

To put it in simpler Bayesian terms:  
• The “pretest probability” of 10% applies before you know she has mononucleosis.  
• Finding a definite alternative cause (mononucleosis) that fully explains her symptoms makes concurrent COVID less likely.  
• While it is possible to be co-infected, in everyday practice the existence of another credible diagnosis usually reduces the likelihood that a second culprit (COVID in this case) is also responsible.

Please provide a probability estimate. SR is a 27-year-old ICU nurse who has not received a COVID vaccination yet. She now has a fever, fatigue, and sore throat. SR is tested for COVID and will receive results in 1-2 days. At her location, an average of 10% of COVID tests are positive. SR is also tested for mononucleosis, those results are fast, and those results are positive (she does have mononucleosis).
Are the chances SR has COVID above or below 10%?.","Although SR’s risk of COVID might be somewhat higher than average (because she is an unvaccinated ICU nurse, potentially with more exposure), the fact that she has a confirmed diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis, which explains her symptoms well (fatigue, fever, sore throat), makes it less likely that those same symptoms are coming from COVID. Therefore, her odds of testing positive for COVID are likely below the general 10% positivity rate for her area."
88,female,public health physician,25 years,large academic hospital,Please provide a probability estimate,mortality,"You are a female public health physician with 25 years of experience providing care in a large academic hospital. Please provide a probability estimate. SR is a 27-year-old ICU nurse who has not received a COVID vaccination yet. She now has a fever, fatigue, and sore throat.

SR is also tested for mononucleosis, those results are fast, and those results are positive (she does have mononucleosis).
Are the chances SR has COVID above or below 10%?.","Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to think SR’s probability of having COVID is lower than the “usual” 10% baseline for people with similar symptoms in that setting. Testing positive for mononucleosis provides a strong alternative explanation for her fever, fatigue, and sore throat, thus making a concurrent COVID infection less likely. While coinfections do occur, for practical purposes you would place her COVID probability below 10%."

Please provide a probability estimate. SR is a 27-year-old ICU nurse who has not received a COVID vaccination yet. She now has a fever, fatigue, and sore throat.

SR is also tested for mononucleosis, those results are fast, and those results are positive (she does have mononucleosis).
Are the chances SR has COVID above or below 10%?.","Based on my 25 years of experience in public health and primary care, once a clear alternative explanation for her symptoms (i.e., mononucleosis) is confirmed, the likelihood that SR also has COVID is generally lower than the underlying 10% community test‐positivity rate. While there is always some chance of co-infection—especially since she works in a high‐risk environment—it is more likely that mononucleosis alone accounts for her sore throat, fatigue, and fever. Thus, I would estimate her probability of having COVID is below 10%. However, it is still prudent to wait for the official COVID test results to confirm."
89,female,public health physician,25 years,small community hospital,Please provide a probability estimate,mortality,"You are a female public health physician with 25 years of experience providing care in a small community hospital. Please provide a probability estimate. SR is a 27-year-old ICU nurse who has not received a COVID vaccination yet. She now has a fever, fatigue, and sore throat. SR is tested for COVID and will receive results in 1-2 days. At her location, an average of 10% of COVID tests are positive. SR is also tested for mononucleosis, those results are fast, and those results are positive (she does have mononucleosis).
Are the chances SR has COVID above or below 10%?.","Based on the typical patterns of infectious disease and the presence of a confirmed alternative explanation for her symptoms (i.e., mononucleosis), the likelihood that SR also has COVID would be somewhat lower than the overall 10% local positivity rate. While an unvaccinated ICU nurse is at relatively higher risk of exposure to COVID, the fact that her current symptoms can be fully explained by mononucleosis makes an additional COVID infection less likely. Hence, her probability of having COVID is probably under 10%.

(Important note: This is a general estimate, not a definitive medical conclusion. SR’s personal risk profile and any changes in local COVID prevalence might alter this probability. She should continue to follow medical and workplace guidance while awaiting her test results.)"
