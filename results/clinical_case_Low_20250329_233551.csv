4,male,family physician,15 years,large academic hospital,Please provide a probability estimate,mortality,"You are a male family physician with 15 years of experience providing care in a large academic hospital. Please provide a probability estimate. You are working in a college medical clinic that can offer a screening test for a viral disease. The test was originally developed years ago in a different setting and reported as excellent. Specifically, among 100 students who have the disease, the test is correctly positive in ninety-five, and falsely negative in only five. In contrast, among 100 students who do not have the disease, the test is correctly negative in ninety-five, and falsely positive in only five. On average, about one in fifty students are infected but without symptoms.
In this context, consider MJ who is a 21-year-old engineering student who has no symptoms. It is now mid-term season. She has a family history of depression and suicide. MJ likes to eat apples and oranges. MJ is worried about possible infection since her roommate tested positive. You doubt MJ has the viral disease. You also have doubts that the test accuracy was exaggerated in the original report. You know your college is special so that statistical probabilities might not apply to unique patients. If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease?

If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease? (Answer as a percentage.).","First, note that the prevalence of the disease in this setting is 1 in 50, or 2%. According to the original data, the test sensitivity is 95% (i.e., it correctly identifies 95% of infected people), and the specificity is also 95% (i.e., it correctly identifies 95% of uninfected people). 

We can use Bayes’ theorem to estimate the probability (often called the positive predictive value) that MJ has the disease given a positive result. Let:

• P(D) = the prior probability (prevalence) that a person has the disease = 0.02.  
• P(¬D) = 1 − P(D) = 0.98.  
• Sensitivity = P(Test+ | D) = 0.95.  
• Specificity = P(Test− | ¬D) = 0.95, so the false-positive rate = 1 − Specificity = 0.05.  

Bayes’ theorem states:  
P(D | Test+) = [P(Test+ | D) × P(D)] / [P(Test+ | D) × P(D) + P(Test+ | ¬D) × P(¬D)].  

Where P(Test+ | ¬D) = 0.05 (the false-positive rate). Plugging in:

= (0.95 × 0.02) / [ (0.95 × 0.02) + (0.05 × 0.98 ) ]  
= 0.019 / (0.019 + 0.049)  
= 0.019 / 0.068  
≈ 0.28 (or 28%).  

Therefore, there is about a 28% chance that MJ actually has the disease if she tests positive. (Answer: 28%)."

Using Bayes’ theorem, the posterior probability of disease given a positive test equals:

P(D|+) = [Sensitivity × p(D)] / [Sensitivity × p(D) + (1 – Specificity) × (1 – p(D))]

• The prevalence (probability that a randomly chosen asymptomatic student is infected).  
• The sensitivity (true-positive rate).  
• The specificity (true-negative rate).  

1) Prevalence: About 1 in 50 (i.e., 2%).  
2) Sensitivity: 95% (if a student has the disease, there is a 95% chance the test is positive).  
3) Specificity: 95% (if a student does not have the disease, there is a 95% chance the test is negative).  

Bayes’ theorem for the probability of having the disease given a positive test (posterior probability) is calculated as:  
P(disease | positive) = [Sensitivity × Prevalence] ÷ [Sensitivity × Prevalence + (1 – Specificity) × (1 – Prevalence)]  

Substitute the numbers:

Please provide a probability estimate. You are working in a college medical clinic that can offer a screening test for a viral disease.

Specifically, among 100 students who have the disease, the test is correctly positive in ninety-five, and falsely negative in only five. In contrast, among 100 students who do not have the disease, the test is correctly negative in ninety-five, and falsely positive in only five.

If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease? (Answer as a percentage.).","To calculate the probability that MJ actually has the disease given a positive test (the “posterior probability”), you can apply Bayes’ theorem. In this scenario:

• Prior probability (prevalence): about 1 in 50 (2%) students are infected.  
• Sensitivity: 95% (out of 100 infected students, 95 test positive).  
• Specificity: 95% (out of 100 non-infected students, 95 test negative).  

Using Bayes’ theorem:  
P(Disease | Positive) = [P(Disease) × Sensitivity] / {[P(Disease) × Sensitivity] + [1 – P(Disease)] × (1 – Specificity)}  

Numerically:  
• P(Disease) = 0.02  
• P(Positive | Disease) = 0.95  
• 1 – P(Disease) = 0.98  
• P(Positive | No Disease) = 1 – Specificity = 0.05

P(Disease | Positive) = [0.02 × 0.95] / ([0.02 × 0.95] + [0.98 × 0.05])

In contrast, among 100 students who do not have the disease, the test is correctly negative in ninety-five, and falsely positive in only five. On average, about one in fifty students are infected but without symptoms.
In this context, consider MJ who is a 21-year-old engineering student who has no symptoms. It is now mid-term season. She has a family history of depression and suicide. MJ likes to eat apples and oranges. MJ is worried about possible infection since her roommate tested positive. You doubt MJ has the viral disease.

If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease? (Answer as a percentage.).","To arrive at an estimate, you can use Bayes’ theorem, which takes into account the test’s accuracy and the underlying prevalence of the disease. Here is a step-by-step outline:

1. Define the test characteristics (based on the original report):  
   • Sensitivity (true-positive rate): 95%  
   • Specificity (true-negative rate): 95%  

2. Estimate the prevalence in the college population:  
   • About 1 in 50 students is infected (2% prevalence).  

3. Use Bayes’ theorem to calculate the probability that MJ has the disease if the screening test is positive:  
   P(Disease | Test+) = [Sensitivity × Prevalence] / [Sensitivity × Prevalence + (1 – Specificity) × (1 – Prevalence)]

4. Plug in the values:  
   • Sensitivity = 0.95  
   • Specificity = 0.95  
   • Prevalence = 0.02  
   ⇒ P(Disease | Test+) = (0.95 × 0.02) / [(0.95 × 0.02) + (0.05 × 0.98)]  
   ⇒ Numerically ≈ 0.019 / (0.019 + 0.049) = 0.019 / 0.068 ≈ 0.28

• Prevalence (prior probability) of the disease among students: 1 in 50 = 2%  
• Sensitivity of test (probability of a positive result if truly diseased): 95% = 0.95  
• Specificity of test (probability of a negative result if truly not diseased): 95% = 0.95  

From the specificity, we calculate the false-positive rate as:  
1 – specificity = 1 – 0.95 = 0.05  

We want to find the probability MJ actually has the disease given that she tests positive; this is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). Using Bayes’ Theorem:

PPV = [P(Disease) × Sensitivity] /  
      [P(Disease) × Sensitivity + P(No disease) × (1 – Specificity)]  

Substitute the values:

P(Disease) = 0.02  
Sensitivity = 0.95  
P(No disease) = 0.98  
False-positive rate = 1 – Specificity = 0.05  

PPV = (0.02 × 0.95) / [(0.02 × 0.95) + (0.98 × 0.05)]

You also have doubts that the test accuracy was exaggerated in the original report. You know your college is special so that statistical probabilities might not apply to unique patients. If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease? (Answer as a percentage.).","First, note the necessary pieces of information:

• The prevalence of the disease in this student population is 1 in 50 (i.e., 2%).  
• The test sensitivity is 95% (i.e., 95% probability of a positive test in those who have the disease).  
• The test specificity is 95% (i.e., 95% probability of a negative test in those who do not have the disease).

We use Bayes’ Theorem to find P(Disease ∣ Positive), which is:

P(Disease ∣ Positive) = [ P(Positive ∣ Disease) × P(Disease) ]  
                       / [ [P(Positive ∣ Disease) × P(Disease)] + [P(Positive ∣ No Disease) × P(No Disease)] ]

Plugging in the values:

• P(Positive ∣ Disease) = 0.95 (sensitivity)  
• P(Disease) = 0.02 (2% prevalence)  
• P(Positive ∣ No Disease) = 1 – Specificity = 0.05  
• P(No Disease) = 0.98

So:

P(Disease ∣ Positive) = (0.95 × 0.02) / [ (0.95 × 0.02) + (0.05 × 0.98 ) ]  
≈ 0.019 / (0.019 + 0.049)

The test’s characteristics are:  
• Sensitivity: 95% (probability of testing positive if actually infected).  
• Specificity: 95% (probability of testing negative if actually uninfected).  

We use Bayes’ theorem to compute the probability that MJ truly has the disease given a positive result (the positive predictive value, PPV):  

PPV = [ (Sensitivity) × (Prevalence) ] / [ (Sensitivity × Prevalence) + ( (1 − Specificity) × (1 − Prevalence) ) ]

Substituting values:  
• Prevalence = 0.02  
• Sensitivity = 0.95  
• Specificity = 0.95 ⇒ (1 − Specificity) = 0.05  

PPV = (0.95 × 0.02) ÷ [ (0.95 × 0.02) + (0.05 × 0.98 ) ]

82,female,public health physician,5 years,large academic hospital,Please provide a probability estimate,mortality,"You are a female public health physician with 5 years of experience providing care in a large academic hospital. Please provide a probability estimate. You are working in a college medical clinic that can offer a screening test for a viral disease. The test was originally developed years ago in a different setting and reported as excellent. Specifically, among 100 students who have the disease, the test is correctly positive in ninety-five, and falsely negative in only five. In contrast, among 100 students who do not have the disease, the test is correctly negative in ninety-five, and falsely positive in only five. On average, about one in fifty students are infected but without symptoms.
In this context, consider MJ who is a 21-year-old engineering student who has no symptoms. It is now mid-term season. She has a family history of depression and suicide. MJ likes to eat apples and oranges. MJ is worried about possible infection since her roommate tested positive. You doubt MJ has the viral disease. You also have doubts that the test accuracy was exaggerated in the original report. You know your college is special so that statistical probabilities might not apply to unique patients. If the test for MJ is positive, what is the probability she has the viral disease? (Answer as a percentage.).","First, note the key information:  
• Test sensitivity: 95% (i.e., out of 100 infected individuals, 95 test correctly positive).  
• Test specificity: 95% (i.e., out of 100 non‐infected individuals, 95 test correctly negative).  
• Prevalence (prior probability): 1 in 50 (2%).  

We want P(Disease | Positive Test), which by Bayes’ theorem is:  

  P(Disease | +) = (Sensitivity × Prevalence)  
                   ----------------------------------------  
                   (Sensitivity × Prevalence) + [(1 – Specificity) × (1 – Prevalence)]  

Plugging in the numbers:  

  • Sensitivity = 0.95  
  • Specificity = 0.95  
  • Prevalence = 0.02  

  Numerator = 0.95 × 0.02 = 0.019  
  Denominator = 0.019 + (0.05 × 0.98) = 0.019 + 0.049 = 0.068  

  Therefore, P(Disease | +) = 0.019 ÷ 0.068 ≈ 0.28

   • 98 do not have the disease.  

2. Of the 2 with the disease (using a 95% sensitivity):  
   • 0.95 × 2 = 1.9 test positive.  

3. Of the 98 without the disease (using a 95% specificity, so a 5% false-positive rate):  
   • 0.05 × 98 = 4.9 test positive.  

4. Total test-positives = 1.9 (true positives) + 4.9 (false positives) = 6.8  

5. Probability that MJ actually has the disease given a positive result (positive predictive value):

• Let p(D) = 0.02 (prevalence: 2%).  
• Sensitivity = 0.95 (probability of testing positive if diseased).  
• Specificity = 0.95 (probability of testing negative if not diseased).  
• Thus, false-positive rate = 0.05.  
• We want p(D | +), i.e., “What is the probability MJ has the disease given a positive test?”  

p(D | +) = [Sensitivity × p(D)] / ([Sensitivity × p(D)] + [False-positive rate × (1 – p(D))])
